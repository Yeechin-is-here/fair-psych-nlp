When that happens, I'll ask someone at the desk what it is asking for to be sure I'm filling it out correctly. Usually when I see my doctor for a yearly checkup and lab tests, we can chat a little about results, whether I need to do anything, and if there is something I want to being up or ask about. My doctor is very busy, but she does seem to want to answer my questions and is a good listener. I know that most of what I might be concerned about isn't a problem, so I don't bring up everything because it would probably be a waste of time.

When there is something I need to do, she gives me options that are based in real, conventional medicine and doesn't try to brush me off by suggesting placebo-like alternative treatments. She seems cautious and checks my lab results, and will take some time to see if my concern is based on an injury or illness during an exam. If something seems like it will clear up on its own, like some pains, she will suggest contacting her office if it doesn't get better in a certain number of days or weeks. I like her style of care and her advice is almost always a good way forward. | Anxiety: It's probably a dumb reason, but her hands are very cold. She's a tiny woman and being in a doctor's office all day doesn't help her warm up. She apologizes, but that makes me a little anxious.

Sometimes if there are too many technical terms being used I might have to ask either my doctor or someone else (my sister is an RN so I can call her and ask for her help) to explain in more plain language. But most of the time I don't have a problem. As far as obtaining services and information, that's a little bit trickier. There's the issue of services being available or not available in my area, long waits to see a doctor, and the massive cost of seeing a doctor. And I've had a few issues where I've gone to the ER or the walk-in clinic in my town and ended up seeing a doctor who doesn't seem to care about explaining what's going on to me.

It seems like he's too willing to write off problems that I'm concerned about as \"probably nothing\". This has happened before with health issues that I ended up seeing other doctors/specialists for (even though he was very reluctant to refer me as he didn't think the issues were real/serious), only to have those specialists confirm that an actual treatable problem existed. He also misdiagnosed me once by saying I probably had bipolar disorder and sending me to a psychiatrist without doing any sort of physical exam or lab testing. I spent two years heavily medicated and miserable before a different doctor realized that the root of my problem was physical/hormol and started to treat me for it.

I had a recent total hysterectomy and it was hard to pull all the information together in terms of estrogen replacement. It's been a year and I am still trying to ascertain the estrogen at my age going away and the swelling and pain I am having. Trying lyrica but that is causing weight gain. Hard to get professionals to see me as not fat but swollen! I ask questions likely better than most because I have a child who has Cerebral Palsy with 2 VP Shunts for hydrocephalus who requires frequent shunt revisions. This has taught me to speak up since he cannot talk. I have to ask all questions and think all the time about what could be \"up.\" I am not afraid to ask any question and when I do meet a stubborn provider for him I am now quick to tell them I will no longer need their services. Then I find another. For me, I usually am not as assertive. | Trust in Physician: I trust her because she is a strong female. Currently she serves in the Army National Guard and just got home from overseas. She is as tough as they come and listens well. I am a little intimidated to tell her things in relation to myself at times because she is so strong. Overall, she knows my home situation and understands being a full time caretaker is a hard job. She makes referrals when necessary and only lets me try meds that she knows will not make me too tired to care for my family member. I don't feel like a number when I see her. Nice office staff helps too! | Anxiety: I am the most anxious that the paper gowns will not fit me. As crazy as it seems I do not want to sit on a paper table in a paper gown. I hate that part. I would rather sit in a cloth gown! They never close and then the paper blanket is usually a joke as well. It is frustrating. I also hate giving blood and that process of waiting to be called to do that. I often say I would run away if I could then we laugh. I mean it though. I know it is necessary but those two things: gowns and blood are my issues. | Numeracy: I hate math! Never was good at it. I demonstrated knowledge when my son was recently life flighted to UNC Chapel Hill for an emergency shunt surgery. He purged and a Resident wanted to do an MRI on him again. I tried to explain with projectile vomiting and laying a kid on his back he could aspirate. The young Resident exclaimed that to put the shunt in he had to guide it with CT. This was the first time I had heard of that. He got sassy with me. I told him the machine would need to be closed down if it got vomit all over it. Eventually I got the charge nurse and I told the young Doctor to be that he was off the case. The Head of his Department came to us and said we were right, my child could aspirate if left on his back in that MRI. (He cannot sit up alone as it is.) I have to advocate all the time or things can be dangerous."}]}

When I went to do the same thing the next day, it clearly was getting worse. I advised my grandmother that it looks like gangrene and she should go get it checked. She did and was admitted to the hospital for gangrene. They would normally take the toe but because of her age they highly recommended we didn't opt for that solution.

Once we got through that and I still wanted the implant she proceeded. While she was putting the implant in I asked her why she asked all those questions even though I scheduled the implant. She said she felt people didn't look at all the information that is out there and sometimes people don't know all the different options they have. She wanted me to know and understand all my options before going forward so I made the best decision for myself.  | Anxiety: I think the thing that makes me feel most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me and don't know if the doctor will know as well.

I have always had an interest in the medical field and worked in a hospital for a brief time about 30 years ago.

But when I did have a regular primary care physician(s) which I did for many years, I felt that in general I could trust them.

For that reason, I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t say that I ever have complete trust in a doctor.

She was frantic but I observed that the cut was relatively minor, was an isolated injury, did not appear to need stitches and there were no apparent breaks or rapid swelling. I soothed her tears by reassuring her as I cleaned her cut thoroughly and applied pressure to stop the bleeding. Then I applied a sterile bandage to the wound and walked her through some gentle range of motion maneuvers to verify that her wrist and elbow were unaffected. Since everything checked out OK, I determined that a trip to a physician was probably not necessary. I cleaned and dressed the wound, changed her bandage over the following week, and her healing progressed without incident."}]}

Sometimes it is hard to understand what the doctor is trying to tell you because at times it seems like they don't actually listen to all you. Lots of time I'll tell my doctor that have certain symptoms for a certain amount of time then the doctor turns around and says something to make me think he did not listen to me. There are times that he can tell me things and I have no idea what he is talking about because he is using medical terms that I'm not familiar with. Example, I had a full panel blood test and when the results came back in a nurse called to tell me that everything was normal but I had no idea what exactly they are testing for and what it means now that the results were normal.  | Trust in Physician: I do trust my doctor for most things but I do believe that doctors do not take people serious unless they can see actual signs themselves. Seems like most doctors send patients back home for a month to see if the symptoms go away or get worse. When most patients come in they have actually already been suffering from the problem for a long time but just waited to see the doctor. I do understand that some patients are lying to the doctor just to get medications or other things. It just seems like the patients really have to convinince the doctor that they really have these problems. I know it has to be hard for the doctors as well because they have to make sure they do not mistreat a patient even if that is what the patient wants. Of course, we have all heard about the few dirty doctors that have lied to patients about have cancer or other illnesses just to profit off the insurance money. We can't forgot about the many drug seeking patients that only want pain pills. That makes it hard on the people who are actually in pain or have cronic pain and really do need pain pills daily.  | Anxiety: I seem to get very anxious when seeing my doctor because I always forget what I need to tell them. I am usually worried about what I may find out at that visit. I sometimes feel worried that the doctor may think I am a little crazy because I do not know how to explain a certain symptom. I am sure they know most of the time what the patient is talking about as they have normally seen that problem before. But with myself I am not good at explain a certain pain or feeling. But as far as actually walking in the office and talking with the staff I always feel comfortable.  | Numeracy: My mom has lots of health issues. I have worked in a couple offices that dealt with the same problems she has so I am able to help my mom understand better what her doctors telling her. When she does not completely understand or even believe what the doctors are saying are correct she can call me and I can tell her if Ive ever dealt with that before. Even though I do not have a lot of knowlegde about medical conditions I seem to know more then a lot of friends and family do. Also, as I'm sure most people use Google to search medical terms or symptoms. I search google for everything so that helps me help others and myself undersand medical stuff. I do know most doctors hate for their patients to search google for medical conditions. With that said most all medical conditions have the same symptoms as other conditions so we should  only take what we find on google or even hear from friends and family very lightly and make sure to always speak with a doctor.

Without trust, how could a physician expect patients to reveal the full extent of their medically relevant history, expose themselves to the physical exam, or act on recommendations for tests or treatments? Trust promotes efficient use of both the patient's and the physician's time. Without trust, the process of informed consent for the most minor of interventions, even a prescribed antibiotic, would become as time consuming as that needed for major surgery.rust may even have therapeutic value, enhancing the efficacy of prescribed treatment.22 Most importantly, trust in the doctor caring for them is of great importance to patients. Patients who trust their doctors rate their care more favorably, as demonstrated by Keating et al.23 in this issue, as well as by others.20,24 Numerous open-ended studies of patients' views about their care, in a variety of contexts, most of which did not include specific hypotheses about trust, have found that patients spontaneously discuss trust and its importance, adding | Anxiety: getting sick or hurt by the doctor and being told something can be wrong People have a fear of doctors for a variety of reasons.

You may be afraid of needles and the sight of blood. If you are claustrophobic, you may fear waiting in a small examination room. If you experience panic attacks, you may fear any situation from which it is inconvenient or difficult to leave quickly, be it a haircut, a shower at the health club, or a visit to the doctor. | Numeracy: hen I was twelve years old, a drunk driver hit the car my mother was driving while I was in the backseat.

I was in the hospital for several weeks and that same paramedic came to visit me almost every day. During my stay, I also got to know the various doctors and nurses in the hospital on a personal level. I remember feeling anxiety about my condition, but not sadness or even fear. It seemed to me that those around me, particularly my family, were more fearful of what might happen to me than I was.
