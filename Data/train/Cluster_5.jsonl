When I enter a doctor's office, and sometimes even before, I am slowed down by the thought of the total cost of the visit. I find it very taxing to my patience that I get charged for my visit to the center, and then I get charged for my doctor's time AND THEN I get charged for my prescription. This is all of course assuming you pay the school's insurance fee which is far higher than the govt marketplace plans available to the public. The second worry I have going in is that whatever I am scheduled to have checked out will be worse than I thought. I have an acute worry that if I go check myself up the doctor will tell me oodles of things that are wrong with me, which sounds scary honestly. I suppose the second reason also ties into extra bills. | Numeracy: I once treated myself for a sexually transmitted disease by ordering antibiotics I had looked up (by affect to body region). I found ciproflaxin for my bladder and urinary tract, and I found doxycycline for my STD health. After looking up how long a trial is of each, I was able to complete two weeks of dosing both. I then paid for a std test at my University Health Center and I tested negative twice, to which I was very happy. In my opinion you don't need a doctor, it's just 99% of people (including myself) will never share the same knowledge as one and medicine in it's concentrated forms can be very hard to dose and apply to select cases. I am glad doctors are around, as anything more complicated than the pills would be beyond me."}

He asked me questions, asked me to show him where it was hurting--all for free. He said for me to keep doing what I was doing which was taking OTC Prilosec.
