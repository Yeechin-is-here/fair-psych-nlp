They may not know as much as someone else\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but the good doctors will go out of their way to learn what they may not know.

I am not sure exactly what quality of mind and character it involves. It is a kind of being sensible. | Anxiety: But doctors can make a different kind of mistake. What I found strange when I first started running the health anxiety clinics was how many patients had been told they had a fatal disease when they did not!  Rather than making the mistake that everyone worries a doctor might make, namely missing the diagnosis of a deadly disease, their doctors worried them unnecessarily by diagnosing deadly diseases that were not present. That happened to me once. I had a swollen leg. Being a health worrier myself at that time, I had already made sure by repeatedly testing myself that I did not have the fatal kidney disease the doctor, when I finally got around to visiting him, informed me blithely that I had. I was able to dismiss his opinion out of hand.  But I have had patients who forever after worried about the disease they were told they had. | Numeracy: We all know stories about doctors who gave their patient a clean bill of health only to see that patient drop dead at their doorstep. Of course, this does not mean the doctor made a mistake. People get sick suddenly and unpredictably.

I tell the person who takes my blood pressure before the doctor comes in to wait a few minutes and ask me the standard questions and refer to my online chart BEFORE taking my blood pressure.

Then when the doctor comes in I tell him that told the assistant again to wait to take my bp(for the umpteenth time) and he takes it and it's fine. | Numeracy: I've been an advocate for those diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Neurologists all over the country give their newly diagnosed patients my phone number and email because they find that I'm better at explaining things than they are sometimes because I've lived with MS for 40 years.

If they had a loose stool, I varied their diet. If their stool appeared hard, I varied their diet.

The problem is when doctors are more concerned with a \"treat and street\" philosophy merely going through the motions to check off boxes for insurance companies than actually LISTENING to patients and taking the time to ask the questions that need to be answered in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.  Patients often do not know that a symptom is just that so when a doctor fails to asks the right questions there will likely not be an accurate diagnosis.  Another issue is when a doctor blatantly ignores my questions.  How many ways to I have to ask the most basic question of what does this diagnosis mean?  More often than not it's just easier to go home and search webmd or the Mayo Clinic website.  Problem with that is I generally end up with even more unanswered questions.  Ultimately I am quite capable of understanding information when it is provided and if my questions are answered with more than a couple of words.  (The correct answer to \"what does the thyroid do?\" is NOT \"Pep\" and after a look of disbelief \"You know, energy\") | Trust in Physician: In the past four years I have been given a misdiagnosis three times because doctors failed to ask the appropriate questions or perform a simple bloodtest.  I spent months in excruciating pain while doctors scratched their heads and did nothing but prescribe medications that did not help and in fact made me feel even worse while my fingers were literally dying.  I could get a shower without literally screaming and curling up in a fetal position afterward.  There is no painkiller that can help that level of pain.  I am quite certain that if they had bothered to check my thyroid levels that I would not have endured a level of misery that makes one question what quality of life is worth living.  I have no trust in the competence of doctors because most are apathetic due in large part to the healthcare system itself. | Anxiety: I am not comfortable getting naked in front of man I do not know.  I do not think that healthcare providers give a patient enough information about what they will be doing BEFORE they do it which makes me very jumpy.  I do not get in another person's personal space without permission or without telling them what I am doing.  I don't think it's too much to ask of virtual strangers especially when I am already naked and vulnerable.  I worry about what tests I will be told I need as many of them are painful or at least uncomfortable especially when someone has an issue with the sight of needles.  I worry about being diagnosed with a condition that could mean significant lifestyle changes or death. | Numeracy: The more often a person is prescribed antibiotics the less effective they will be.  When I do have sinusitis that is bad enough to make me actually see a doctor (feeling like I am dying) I have to tell them not to bother writing a script for amoxicillin because I won't bother filling it as it will not work, it's like eating a bottle of Tic Tacs for me at this point."}]}

Because of my knowledge, I was concerned that she may be at risk for stroke and her blood pressure was very high. I retook her blood pressure because if you get an abnormal reading, you should always recheck under the same circumstance. She had a headache also, so after rechecking her blood pressure was still around 170 systolic. I told her that we need to go to the ER because I was concerned about how high her BP is and her risk of stroke. She also smokes cigarettes, so her risk is increased. Her symptoms could have been dangerous and the abnormal visual hallucinations could have been aura for an oncoming migraine, but I didn't want to take any chances. I took her to the ER. She ended up being fine. "}]}
