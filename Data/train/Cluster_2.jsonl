The doctors some times look you in the eye, and some times they do not.  Some times the doctors are compassionate and give you the time that you need, some times the doctor's offer advice, but most of the time they give you a script and send you on your way. Once in a while a doctor will listen to you, understand how you are feeling and send you off to another doctor.  This doctor will some times give you the amount of time that you need, give you another script, as well as give you another appointment. Now you are seeing two doctor's, the original doctor who referred you to the second doctor - making certain that you are happy with the referral doctor, and then you go back to the referral doctor for treatment. | Trust in Physician: Trust is a two way street.  The doctors do not trust you when you are in pain.  Because they do not trust you when you are in pain, the doctors decide that it is a good thing to poke and prod you until you actually scream.  After they hear you scream, they then decide that \"oh, maybe you are in pain\". That is when you will be given a hand full of papers otherwise known as referrals, to go to a place where they do x-rays.  After signing in with them, you have to fill out all of the paperwork once again.  It is a tedious job to continue to fill out the same forms over and over again.  The referral doctor takes the x-rays, and tells you to make an appointment with your original (primary) doctor.  The doctor that tells you to make the appointment with the primary doctor will then read your x-rays and send the results to your primary doctor. It seems to me that the primary (original) doctor is just sending you back and forth to different doctors to get additional payments from the insurance company.  I just do not trust any doctor.......they are all out for themselves. | Anxiety: I do not go to the doctors when I have a cut finger or a bruise.  I only go to the doctors when I am sick, and I do not need to be poked, prodded, felt up, have things inserted etc. Why so I need a stranger touching me, I do not like to be touched, that is why I do not fly.  There is some thing wrong with a stranger touching you saying this is going to hurt a bit etc. Doctors make me feel very uneasy and nervous, which makes me very unhappy. | Numeracy: I do not have any experiences in my life that demonstrates any knowledge of health or medical issues.  Oh wait, I take that back.  A friend of mine had medical issues.  He went to many doctors that could or did not know what was wrong with him.  They basically sent him from doctor to doctor, test to test, and they were never able to give him a direct answer to what his problem was. When he ended up in the hospital, the doctors in the emergency room said that there was nothing wrong with him and sent him home.  The next time when the ambulance took him, the staff at the hospital was again going to send him back home, again stating that there was nothing wrong with him.

I do research online to supplement what I learn during appointments as well as to find more information on issues that may not be significant enough to take up a lot of appointment time. Occasiolly I have to interact with a medical professiol who seems to not be paying attention (or seems to dislike me), and I do find that frustrating and tend to not communicate very well in those situations. But overall, I feel pretty confident in my ability to understand and communicate about my medical issues. | Trust in Physician: I do not have a primary care physician and avoid seeing doctors when at all possible. However, I do see a clinical psychologist at least weekly, and I trust her completely. She has been working with me for several years now, has been very helpful, and always seems to have her patients' interest first. She goes out of her way to be kind and respect who I am as a person. As for doctors in general, my experiences have been very mixed - some very caring and helpful, others very cold, disrespectful, and arrogant. With that being the case, when I do have to resort to seeing a doctor, I try to keep an open mind, but I also find that I try to gather as much pertinent information as possible before I go to an appointment, communicate the problem clearly (and ONLY the current problem, no extraneous information), and let them know what has worked for me in the past if I've had this issue before. I find it difficult to trust doctors who seem to have their own agenda - for instance, ones who insist on prescribing medications that I know are not really effective for me, or ones who treat every patient as though they're a drug addict (and there are a LOT of these doctors in our area). | Anxiety: When I sense that the doctor has their own agenda rather than responding to the patient in front of them, it makes me very anxious. When the doctor exhibits arrogant behavior or seems disrespectful, I worry that they won't really listen to me or will discount what I have to tell them. When a doctor seems to assume that every patient is displaying drug-seeking behavior, I worry that they aren't really listening and that I will not get the right treatment. | Numeracy: A few years ago, a nurse practitioner prescribed buspirone for my anxiety. I reminded him that psychiatric drugs in general tend to affect me much more strongly than they do most people, and suggested that I should start at the lowest dose possible. He wrote the prescription for the second lowest dose available. When I got home with the medication, I broke the tablets into quarters for the first week, then into halves for the next week. I didn't have any adverse effects, but did not really see any positive effects either, so on the third week, I took whole tablets as prescribed. I got very useated, extremely dizzy, and found it nearly impossible to stay awake. I continued at the recommended dose, thinking that maybe these were side effects that would wear off with time, but they persisted. I tried to reach the nurse practitioner, but he was on vacation and I didn't feel comfortable discussing it with anyone else in the office, so I went online and looked up information about the medication. I learned that what I was experiencing were symptoms of a severe overdose of the medication. Going to an emergency room was recommended, but I felt certain that no one would listen to me if I tried to explain my drug sensitivity and that they'd probably think I took some illegal drug. I'm aware that some psychiatric drugs recommend tapering off rather than stopping abruptly, so I looked for this information online and found that while it's not recommended to stop abruptly, in some situations it may be necessary. I decided that this was one of those situations, so I stopped taking the medication. The symptoms decreased appreciably within several hours, and though there was some lingering dizziness, everything else was more or less back to normal within a few days."}

I did not do this for money.  I did this because being a doctor always appealed to me.  I like to solve problems and the human body and what it is capable of astonishes me.  I like to think that most if not all doctors got into medicine for the same reasons.  They want to build that trust with their patients.

I have an unnatural fear of death anyways.  I do not have a regular physician because I am almost never sick.  So on occasion, when I have been sick or something has been wrong that I felt that I needed to go the doctor, I have worried that I would hear bad news.  The mind tends to go to worse case scenario.  I go to get a yearly mammogram and a yearly pap smear-neither of which is a pleasant experience just for the fact that it leaves me exposed. So that is enough to cause anxiety but add to that the possibility that they will find something wrong is always enough to cause worry. | Numeracy: When I was 24 years old, I went to the doctor to get my yearly physical exam.  Up to that point, I had been having them for 6 years without any issues but this time, the doctor called me the following week to tell me that I had an irregular pap smear and that the pap had shown that I had precancerous cells.  Because I had taken anatomy for 3 years and I was pretty enlightened on how the different type of cells all line up in  woman's reproductive parts, I instantly knew that it was serious.  I did not complain or argue when he got me into a specialist for the following week.  The specialist advised that he had to do a LEEP which again, I was familiar with so I had some comfort only because I knew what the process entailed."}

No problem. But when I get into harder-to-diagnose issues (like the vertigo I've had for more than a decade), doctors tend to under-explain things and make a lot of assumptions that can make it hard to get useful information from them. My vertigo was never diagnosed by my then-doctor despite him running a bunch of tests I couldn't afford that all came back fine; I filly figured out the issue for myself (badly-adjusted new glasses that caused chronic eyestrain I still struggle with).

It's been a long time since I've seen a doctor who didn't seem rushed and eager to hurry up and go on to the next patient.

And in terms of processing, I feel like they're always going too fast for me kind of like I said before.  | Trust in Physician: Doctors in general are pretty untrustworthy I think.

Also the being touched thing is obviously a huge source of anxiety as well which stems more from my personal history. Like I'm 22 and I still haven't had a pap smear because I just can't do it. And I had an older male doctor as a kid who didn't explain what he was doing and was examining me and it was just a weird and difficult experience and it's hard to advocate for yourself with a doctor when they always think they know best. Sorry this answer is so long I hope it kind of made sense! Also bruh I don't understand health insurance for the life of me so that makes me worried too.

I would say that the only issue that would keep me from telling all of the information behind something that is bothering me is having a lack of comfort with the specific doctor or nurse I see that day. This usually only happens during urgent care visits. I always ask questions even if the doctor does not seem interested because, as the patient, I deserve to know exactly what could happen to me. Health is something that people should have a blas\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9 attitude towards. | Trust in Physician: I have a lack of trust with physicians when they seem to be completely distant from me when I am giving them information or explaining my situation. It boils down to them having a lack of social skills - I often feel like when I am being shooed out of an office to get me out as soon as possible, it feels as though I am not worth their time. Again, this often happens when I am at an urgent care clinic or with doctors that I am seeing for the very first time. Also, a lack of professionalism shows me that they could potentially be wrong about a prescription.  | Anxiety: The fear of being told something could be seriously wrong with my health is the main thing that stresses me out. Another factor is, being a person who has struggled with eating disorders, being told the number on the scale, whether it is higher or lower than I expect, gives me so much anxiety. After hearing the number, I don't think about anything else and I usually revert to bad behavior. Anything that involves my weight puts me on edge - it's very triggering for me and, unfortunately, hearing information about it form a doctor is very important, so it is inevitable that I become nervous during a visit. | Numeracy: Once a year, I usually get a very bad case of the flu and I never go to the doctor to get medication or to get a check up. I avoid going to the doctor so much and despise the thought of getting told bad news about my health that I just tough it out. It can potentially last for months at a time, and even though I know in the back of my head that if I go to the doctor's office they could probably prescribe a medication that could help me much faster than whatever is over the counter, I do not go. I know I am in the wrong and it really shows a lack of understanding when it comes to medical issues. "}

But I don't necessarily trust them to have the same priorities I do.

Yes, there was a small chance I had PCOS. Yes, if I had had it, there would have been a small chance of heart problems (all the other symptoms were things I considered either no big deal like hair, or actually beneficial, like amenorrhea and infertility). But good God, $1000! Insurance wouldn't even cover it! I could NOT convince that man that I was poor. So I no longer trust him to make decisions for me, because we don't see eye-to-eye about what's important. | Anxiety: I guess there's always the back-of-the-mind fear that the doctor will find something wrong. That's not usually a huge concern for me, though, because I've always been quite healthy aside from my weight, which I'm working on. Mostly I'm just anxious because there's nearly always SOMETHING uncomfortable in a doctor's visit. Taking off more clothes than I'd like to, or painful examitions (and I have a VERY low pain threshold - I consider those blood pressure cuffs painful), or being told yet again that I'm overweight as if I couldn't see that for myself. | Numeracy: A few weeks ago, my brother hit his head at work. He'd had several mild concussions as a child and pretty much self-diagnosed himself as having another one this time. (Yes, that's wildly irresponsible. Yes, he should have gone to the doctor. You know what, tell it to fucking Nikki Haley because it's her fault he's not insured.) He did some research about concussion and painkillers and said he needed to take something other than Excedrin, preferably Tylenol. He was pretty upset because we didn't have any Tylenol and his head hurt. So I realized that often, different me brands of the same medicine will have similar mes, and another painkiller that ended in \"ol\" might have the same active ingredient as Tylenol. I looked up the active ingredients online and checked the bottle to make sure, and then gave him a Midol from my supply. So most of the medical knowledge in that scerio came from him, but I was the one who realized that Midol would probably help and did the research to verify it."}
