I have access to these physical people, as well as the Internet in order to gain information about anything else that I don't understand. I'll use it sometimes to check basic drug interactions that I can't remember, such as Tylenol and Aleve, or other such over the counter medications.

I'm generally a nervous person, but when it comes to my health I do the best I can in order to receive all of the information I need, and not allow myself to feel bullied into making choices that may not be right for me. | Trust in Physician: I have seen my primary care physician for a few years now, and have only seen my health improve during this time. I have had no reason to distrust her or feel that her opinions of me are biased in any way. She has always been open to any questions I have, and has been willing to look at a variety of options for medical issues that I have had, and adjust things based on how I feel. She'll check in to make sure that I've followed up with other appointments as necessary, and I just generally tend to feel that she really cares about her patients. I don't feel like I'm in a rush, and she always treats me like a person, not just part of her job, which I appreciate. I've also looked online and she's had good ratings from other people, as well as working with a highly rated medical group that other members of my family have gone to as well. I feel like she has the resources available to help with any treatment I may need, and has utilized them in the past when she thought some other specialist may be of more help than she is. Prior to this, I didn't have good experiences with doctors. They tended not to listen to my problems, and were quick to make assumptions. In one case, a doctor refused to listen to the fact that I believed I was allergic to a medication I was taking, and I actually ended up in the ER. This current doctor is the first one that I feel listens and is actually willing to help with any issues that I have come up. | Anxiety: It has nothing to do with my doctor herself, or her staff. I'm just not a huge fan of sitting in waiting rooms, and I feel like that tends to cause my heart rate to rise and then for me to just get nervous about being there in general. I feel like hospitals and doctor's offices just have a certain smell to them that I'll never fully get used to. My main issue with my health is also having a history of anxiety disorders, so that definitely plays a huge roll in how I feel about doctor's visits. I think that I work myself up thinking about the unknown, and fearing that something will be wrong, even when I'm just having a routing checkup and no reason to believe that something is actually wrong. | Numeracy: An experience I has that demonstrated my knowledge of medical issues was when I cut my finger, and due to a rather large snowstorm, was unable to leave to possibly get it looked at. I went ahead and washed it out with hot water, and disinfected the cut on my finger. I also went ahead and elevated it slightly and applied pressure until most of the bleeding had stopped.

I understand vaccines are important, second opinions are important for any major health issues/procedures, and I have a firm grasp on information.

This is because I understand that doctors are less likely to take women's reported symptoms seriously, medications that may be prescribed are tested much less thoroughly on women than on men, and especially in obstetrics women are not given important information to monitor their own health during/after childbirth which leads to the US having an incredibly high maternal death rate for a first-world country.

I am a graduate student in Information (Human-Computer Interaction) as well as someone who has worked in libraries and bookstores on college campuses for several decades. My family includes many doctors and nurses, and I grew up reading medical material in the form of textbooks and magazines because there was so much of it around the house.  I'm married to a doctor, and he's very happy to help me with any questions I have, but I rarely have a question I can't find the answer to on the internet almost immediately.

The sentence contains an absolute, so it's not clear. Next, to sum up how much I trust my doctor, I'd say I generally trust her, and I think that she's a competent person with good intentions, but that she also has a reasonable amount of self-interest and might not be above soft-selling me something I don't really need, like botox. I don't think that she would lie to me about it, though. She has a fairly conservative point of view about prescribing medications and I appreciate that. | Anxiety: I'm not that fond of some of the more invasive routine procedures. I'm also aware of the history of medicine, and am concerned that some procedures might be more harmful than currently known (such as mammograms)  | Numeracy: The other night, I was having dinner with extended family, and we were discussing a situation in which a family acquaintance was given something to slow down labor because the baby was not to term yet. My father in law expressed skepticism about what could possibly be done for the child, and my husband (again, he's a doctor) explained that they don't have to delay the birth by much in order to give the mother a drug that will vastly accelerate the baby's ability to breathe outside the womb. I asked if that drug had anything to do with surfactant, and my husband affirmed that it indeed had. I don't remember where I read that information, but I read a lot of medical papers for my work, and I read quite a bit about prenatal development while my own child was gestating. "}]}

It was not how I envisioned my life to be and was hopeful that I would work until full retirement age of 66 or later.  Visiting the cancer center is not a big deal. | Numeracy: In 2004, I took a bad fall in front of the hospital I worked at which resulted in a fractured right hip.  It required surgery and 4 weeks later after a rehab stay I was home and regaining my mobility and living life at a much slower pace.

I did everything as ordered and because I was familiar with medical jargon I was a good patient."}]}

I find medical forms a challenge as I am dyslexic and also an immigrant. I usually have my husband read them over or fill them out for me. | Trust in Physician: My primary care physician over prescribes, he's given me so many steroidal medications for simple viral infection, just because I have very mild asthma. He also gives antivirals, orders chest xrays even when I have no noise in my chest. It's too much and too often. He also isn't informed about mental health, I tried to ask for counseling and he couldn't find a list, then when he found it half the numbers on it were no longer in service or the providers didn't take my insurance. | Anxiety: Because of my pre existing condition I suffer extreme fatigue, yet so many of the doctors want to prescribe me meds that have fatigue as a side effect, like gabapentin. I have to explain that I won't take medication that will fatigue me because I have a small child to take care of. I can barely function as it is with my level of disability, I don't want things that make it worse. Also I have a liver issue Gilbert's syndrome, that affects how I process medication. I've had weird side effects, for example to stemetil for nausea and was told by my doctor they only saw that in children or people with compromised liver enzymes. I have had bad reactions to all types of anti depressants from tri cyclics through SSRIs, which caused me in the former to be almost comatose and dissociated to in the later case have uncontrollable muscle spasms. I feel disbelieved by doctors and dread seeing them because they always want to give me drugs that give me adverse effects. The drugs that don't bother me so much they won't prescribe. For example NSAIDs completely mess up my stomach and acetaminophen is bad for my liver, so the best drug for pain relief for me is a small amount of codeine, not tramadol, not vicodin, not percocet, all the artificial opioids make me hallucinate, but codeine does not. However physicians wont prescribe codeine to me. I have complex over lapping conditions and none of my doctors talk or communicate with each other. I see a neurologist, a gastroenterologist, a urologist, an ent doctor, a breast specialist, an ob gyn. I get overwhelmed with all the advice and the lack of effective treatments for my diseases. | Numeracy: I've been disabled with a neurological illness that is poorly understood since I was 18 years old. I often know more about my conditions than my doctors do, because I've done a lot of research over the past 31 years of being sick. My doctor in my previous country of residence, used to ask me what treatment I would think would be beneficial for myself before suggesting anything. She told me I should have been a doctor, I used to brief her on the latest research findings into my illness and highlight relevant passages for her to help her treat others she saw with my disease."}]}

I feel that in most situations the information is easy for me to understand. There have been times when I needed more clarity on forms and medical terms or diagnosis. The times when I needed clarity I usually turn to the internet first before I turn to a doctor or nurse to get the information I need to make it more understandable. Getting a hold of a doctor or nurse on the phone usually is a long process that I like to avoid. I like to get my information rapidly and not have to wait for a call back from a doctor or nurse. I think in my case it really helps that I took courses in college dealing with anatomy and physiology and disease. This makes it far easier for me to understand the information the doctor is telling me. I know in my own family there is often a lot of confusion over understanding health information. So I think it is a matter of having had exposure to certain terms and subjects in healthcare.   | Trust in Physician: In general I have a distrust for my primary care physician and doctors in general. I feel this way because whenever I have had a medical issue it is rare that I get any kind of resolution or any real help. I feel that doctors are so quick to medicate and not find out what the underlying issue is creating the problem. Because any doctors are of any real help I try to avoid going to them even when I need it. It seems like no matter how many blood tests or other kinds of medical tests one gets there is never any resolution to the problem only a cover up of the problem. I feel like doctors just cover the surface and never really dig deep to understand the problem. I do believe there are rare doctors that will dig deep and get the medical problem and try to solve it, but these doctors are extremely rare. In addition I feel like doctors do not take time with their patients anymore. There is no caring. It feels like they try to see as many patients as possible and never really take the time to get to know someone and their needs. In all I can't trust doctors anymore. At one time I trusted them more but I have seen the medical profession really decline in quality of care.  | Anxiety: I think what make me anxious is just the whole environment of being at the doctor's office. It is not a comfortable feeling at all. It makes me feel very anxious. Further it makes me worried because I always feel like they are going to say things that are terrible. Or that the doctor is going to do tests I do not want nor like. In all the atmosphere of the doctor's office makes me anxious at best. It is not a good feeling. It just evokes bad feelings and the want to not even go. The anticipation sitting in the examination room waiting for the doctor not only creates anxiety but also worry. I have never been to the doctor's office and can say I felt at ease and calm. The whole experience of going to the doctor is just not conducive of good feelings.  | Numeracy: My son was being evaluated by a cardiologist for a heart condition. The doctor was explaining to me that his pulmonary valve has stenosis and hence had a diagnosis of pulmonary valve stenosis. Because I had recently took a course in college on the heart and how it functions I knew what the word stenosis meant. I also knew the hearts structure and functioning. Without the course I took in college I probably would not have known these terms nor had an understanding how the heart functions or its structures. Because I had prior knowledge of the heart it made it much easier for me to ask questions of the doctor about the diagnosis. It made me feel more at ease when communicating with the doctor because I knew the basic medical terms when referring to the heart. "}]}

The only issue I have is that I had a really bad experience with a doctor in the same practice and I don't really like to see him.  If I do, I just pretend that he isn't there. It is so worth it to see our current doctor that I will deal with seeing the other doctor for a minute or so when we are walking to the exam room. | Numeracy: My mom had ALS.  We cared for her at home for 10 years with nursing help during the day.  She was non ambulatory. She was on a ventilator and feeding tube for the majority of that time. I knew how to administer her medication and feed her, change her catheter, change out vent tubing, suction her throat.  She needed total care.  I could care for her myself when we did not have a nurse.  "}]}

I began to take the blood test and scopy tests results and learn what each thing meant. I went and got a blood review done and was able to see my cells and learn what the shape and distribution of my cells in the vial mean.

We had our flu shots so our fevers weren't extremely high (less than 101).  The accompanying symptoms were severe fatigue, cough, nausea and an extreme sore throat.

I watched my son's throat for a few days and there weren't any unusual signs until last Thursday night when white spots started showing up.  At that point, my usual wait and see on a fever and cough symptoms turned into a doctor's appointment.  I've learned to wait out viruses but not to mess with what could be a possible strep.  Thankfully it wasn't strep but I knew what to look for and be concerned from past experience.  "}]}

I forget some health issues from the past, After a visit I need time to rethink everything again and to talk to the doctor but nobody has that time, I read a lot of health articled and follow famous health blogger, knowing some information I feel confused because sometimes I see conflict between the information I know and the doctor's opinion. I would like everything to be consistent and logically understandable but it is not. In some of the cases doctors are working with old knowledge, and they do not make connection between the health problems and prefer to focus on one instead of the total picture. | Trust in Physician: I distrust all the doctors because I do not see that they try to help, they just thinking how to sell expensive medicine or expensive treatment. They offered my son a new medicine for treating his allergy for $100 out of pocket, this medicine is extremely new and doesn't tested enough, knowing that allergy problems start from the gut I can't except the doctor who sell skin creme and doesn't think about the gut. This doctor drives Tesla is that possible, no.

The times are changing and humanity is so important for this profession. I worry every time how expensive will be the next prescribed medicine and what are the side effects, I try to read everything carefully and when read the long list of side effects I become more and more frustrated.

Then I found a holistic doctor doctor who recommended change in the food diet and test for food intolerance, my ob-gyn doctor started laughing at this and said this is silly. But I did everything my holistic doctor told to me, I even started core gymnanstics and acupuncture and 7 months later I was pregnant with my first child, so I read tons of books, blogs, articled, I tried a lot of things and succeed."}]}

I had to switch twice at the end of my last pregnancy and was delivered by a midwife. The first OB/GYN was trying to force me to have a c-section for no reason, the second didn't support unmedicated birth and my chiropractor implored me to change to a midwife because she specializes in pregnancy and found that her patients had more success with midwives for unmedicated birth. I also had a doula and the birth was still tense due to the overbearing OBs in the practice, who almost forced me to have a c-section as well. Thankfully my doula was there to fight for me to get the birth I wanted.  | Anxiety: During my last pregnancy, OBs would have me stay overnight in the hospital for non-stress testing, simply because they wanted to spend time with their families and didn't want to wait around for the hour it would have taken to observe me. Also, the nurses would tell me to drink water so they wouldn't order an IV, but the doctors always forced me to have an IV, even when I was in the hospital for a short time, drinking water the entire time. Once, the nurse tried to put in an IV three times, permanently damaging my left arm. When she gave up on my left, and starting stabbing my right arm, I was scared I wouldn't be able to use either of my hands the next day. Anyway, all of that was unnecessary and when someone is pregnant in particular, in the US, the doctors only care for the fetus, not the mother. This is why the US has such a high maternal mortality rate...this was told to me by a nurse and public health professional. | Numeracy: I was talking to another patient in my doctor's office about acupuncture in pregnancy and related issues.

I am getting ready to make my 3 month appointment for Monday. | Anxiety: Since I do not feel these emotions when visiting my primary care physician, I will describe those feelings of going to my previous dentist.  I used to have these feelings when visiting my dentist because I wasn't taking good care of my teeth. I think I don't have these feelings now is because I have taken an active role in my total healthcare. | Numeracy: My knowledge about health issues, starting with myself, was when I had my wisdom teeth pulled under general anesthesia at the age of 22.

Everything is either your dehydrated, to walk, go check your eyes and other hairbrained answers.  I wish old school doctors still existed.  These young ones are terrible. | Anxiety: I don't care for doctors or emergency rooms that's what makes me anxious.  I waste my time.  The reason why I get anxious and worried is because of my experience with a majority of doctors, urgent care, and emergency rooms.  I had surgery for a hystertomy, got staph, had 4 doctors visits including urgent care, and ER, went in shock and no one would believe me until a nurse at the ER had tested me after I left the ER.  My GYN said it was pop, my primary doctor completely ignored me after I told her don't look at the paper results look at me, the Urgent care said to take an extra high blood pressure bill, and the ER doctor had me touching my nose with my finger and diagnosed with urinary infection i had no symptoms for.  I suffer to this day and yes I still get hairbrained answers like to go check my eyes for the brain fog.  So that is why I get anxious.  Finally I did get a good learning urologist who performed the other half of my surgery for a urinary band who saw how sick I was and she saved my life from the staph infection after weeks of begging someone to listen that I felt like death. | Numeracy: Been to the doctor too many times.  I don't really care for how much percent of what or what was read or taught in a book.  The best doctors are the ones that listen to what the patient is telling you, and if the doctor doesn't know let him do the research not the patient.  Example  I got staph went into shock.  No one could pick up on that.  That's sad even when I gave a urine tests.  They say so you took a pill and it went away.  No, after the shock it made my whole body ache and still does to this day I am stiff and tired and not what I was before.  Did the doctors ever study and find out what happens to people after staph. NO.  Cause it wasn't in a book.  So If I didn't get knowledge about health or my medical I would be six feet under by now."}]}

I am in my 50s and was never in great health, even as a child. I have multiple serious and chronic conditions.

Even when something new is being presented to me, I have a strong base of general medical knowledge from which I can pull to understand what I'm being told.

Whenever she makes a recommendation she goes into a lot of detail about her logic behind the recommendation and explains why others might have a different opinion. I usually do some research after my appointments with all physicians in order to make sure that I understand all aspects of my illness or treatment and have never found the information my current doctor gives me to be lacking in any way. | Anxiety: Most of my anxiety is the result of concerns about what my diagnosis might be and whether or not my treatment is effective. One of the chronic illnesses I have can have serious, life-threatening consequences if not treated properly as can the medications I take for it. I am not anxious about the actual physical process of being examined, with the exception of paps smears and mammograms as these are sometimes a painful process. I normally choose female physicians for all of my medical procedures and this the direct result of years of interacting with male doctors, many of who did not seem to understand my efforts to communicate symptoms. It may be me or it may have been them, but the end result is that I am much less anxious in any medical situation when I am attended to by a female doctor. | Numeracy: Recently my Mother woke up ill and my step-father was taking care of her. He told me that she had a bad stomach ache and that it was probably her gallbladder as he had had gallstones and his symptoms were similar.

I spoke to her and found out that she was vomiting a brown substance which I know can be the result of bleeding in the stomach.
