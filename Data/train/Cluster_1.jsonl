I took a few medical assistant classes in college because I was studying to be a medical assistant a few years ago.

I was told by another physician that many doctors have contracts with certain pharmaceutical companies, and because of this they are persuaded to recommend that company's medications, even though they know it won't fix their pain or conditions.

I worry about these because a child can easily get these illnesses from just being at the store and someone sneezes or coughs. They can even get sick if someone coughed on an item in the store and I touch it and then hold my kids. Being a parent is already worrying but having to worry about their health whenever something like this arises, is very stressful and irritating because I tend to get really antsy and nervous while waiting for the doctor's diagnosis. I had to take my daughter to the ER a few times because she had a high fever temperature, and at the time there was a big outbreak of the flu that was nationwide and causing deaths for some young kids and the elderly. Because of this reason, I decided to take my daughter to the doctor to make sure she was alright. She ended up being fine but just the information on the news and the media and her being sick just made the whole situation nerve wrecking.  | Numeracy: An experience I had that showed my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I took my son to the doctor's office. I had remembered reading about certain signs the body gives away that are an indication of other issues during my studying in the medical field. My son was having a high fever and sweating a little and I figured he was teething because he was also drooling. Sure enough, I was correct when I talked to the doctor about it.

When I need to select a specialist, I rely entirely on here, as she can learn in 5 minutes what would take me much longer. Who would know best about which doctor to select than a nurse with access to other nurses who know. | Trust in Physician: We selected our primary care physician based on a recommendation from our daughter after we moved. We have been completely satisfied with the family practice (my wife and I have different doctors in the practice). From day one, I got along well with my physician. We bonded, I think, partly because I was teaching at his alma mater (after retiring from my full-time position elsewhere). He will lay out various treatment options in a fair and unbiased way and leave the decision to me. Have never ever felt rushed. He takes the time that is necessary and we also toss in a discussion of sports, which is fun and makes me feel very comfortable (especially compared to some snooty specialists I have met over the years). | Anxiety: One incident stands out from my 67 years - my current physician said \"we\" needed to check my heart again. Turns out I had a murmur. Subsequent tests revealed a mitral valve problem, which will be corrected via robotic surgery. That was scary for me and still is as the surgery has not been scheduled. Generally, I am somewhat apprehensive concerning new complaints (e.g, a mole). Part of my anxiety is related to having seen family members suffer with various diseases. For example, my father died of cancer at age 40 (I was 11). My mind tends to go to \"cancer\" when I have an otherwise unexplained pain. Generally, however, I find the typical examination to be quite routine and not anxiety inducing (except in the circumstances i have outlined above). | Numeracy: I have been on clonazepam for years (for insomnia). Due to a mix-up, the prescription lapsed. Due to the fact that I had been on the drug for so long, my body experienced withdrawal. It was strange that I needed to hold onto the wall of the shower to take a shower. Fortunately, I have not had a similar problem. Got to the doctor asap and got the prescription re-issued.

These details increase the skepticism I have for specific diagnoses and treatments as it can be hard to tell if a course of action is necessary or if it is just a profit center for the doctor/hospital prescribing the treatments or diagnostics. | Trust in Physician: I trust my primary care physician for the following reasons: She is always attentive and shows interest in my line of questioning when it comes to description of symptoms, inquiries with regards to preventative maintenance (i.e. discussing future concerns based on age, family history as it relates to my current health, etc.). I never feel rushed during a routine visit when it comes to discussing concerns and overall health strategies. Overall, I feel that she cares about my well-being. My main distrust point with my primary care physician is the \"physical\" side of routine examinations. I feel like she is less comprehensive during the exam than my prior physician with regards to tests and covering all aspects of the exam. This is an additional concern now that I am older and more susceptible to common problems (e.g. enlarged prostate, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.). | Anxiety: I tend to be an anxious person in general and have a family history of high blood pressure, anxiety, etc. This often manifests in \"white coat syndrome\" when my physician or a nurse takes my blood pressure. It is usually off the charts the very first test, and sometimes it stays that way throughout the examination. This issue is further compounded as my employer/insurer has a \"wellness program\" that ties the outcomes of routine examinations with insurance premiums for the year, so there is extra incentive to maintain healthy numbers (with blood pressure being one of those numbers). For that reason, I record weekly blood pressure measurements to bring with me to examinations; unfortunately, my normalized recordings are not the ones that make it \"into the record\" for the wellness visit numbers... | Numeracy: I had a friend/coworker who had a peculiar change in some patterns that I noticed.

Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile samples.  | Anxiety: As stated in the letter of intent, the NHMFL offers the capability to measure actinide materials under unique conditions.

Most of the time I can understand, and process the diagnoses that I have been given, and with the help of online resources the doctors job is not as necessary to explain in detail if I don't understand something or have questions I can quickly look it up and if I am still confused I can contact my doctor in order for he she to clear things up for me. | Trust in Physician: I feel very neutral about my trust towards my primary car physician. I can not whole heartedly put all my faith into them. That why I strive to get second opinions if something does go wrong. I go see a specialist in order to better understand, and make sure I am not being misdiagnosed. There have been instances when I do not believe my doctor has made the right decision such as not prescribing the right dosage of a medication, and I have struggled to come to terms with that. Until then I still go cause its a convenient location, and accepts my insurance. | Anxiety: Nothing makes me feel anxious more than just having to wait in the waiting room. It seem unnecessary to have an appointment at a certain time then be force to wait another 30 minutes or so. Can be very frustrating when they do this at the office. I get anxious because I could have been doing better things with my time then spending it at a waiting room. This waiting time feeds into my anxiety, but most of the time I feel like I am in the clear, and have no issues I should be worried about since I get tested every three months. | Numeracy: I went a course on how to provide cpr to a paitient no I am ready for when ever anything happens to one of my family members in order to administer CPR. I know that it can revive someone having a heart attack, and my father has had a heart attack so just in case it happens again I can bring him back to life again. I also spend a lot of time with my grandmother so it will be very useful to know this knowledge beforehand just in case anything happens. I highly recommend everyone taking a CPR course and learning about what it can do for people in danger."}

I feel this way because i consider myself intelligent.  In addition , or maybe it goes hand and hand, i do my research on any topic i have questions on. I will never blindly take the advice or recommendations of Doctors/Nurses without also doing my own due diligence.  | Trust in Physician: It isn't so much that i distrust my Dr. the individual, but rather i distrust the system. The system seems to have been bogged down and become nothing but a business. I was diagnosed with diabetes and a couple of other conditions three years ago and my Dr's wasn't willing to discuss much with me other than wanting to throw pills at me. I refused the pills and wanted to talk about diet, exercise, carb intake, etc.  The Dr. said she couldn't discuss this and referred me to a nutritionist that wanted $1200 up front. A Dr. should know (and probably does) the very basic starting points for diabetes care.  So, this is one big reason why i don't trust the system too much. It seems there is no persol or individual care given; just a Dr. reading from a playsheet on which pill to give for which condition. She spent zero time educating me about diabetes other than a useless pamphlet. Everything i learned i did on my own. So, in summary, i don't have too much faith in the medical profession at times because they seem more geared towards business, profit and blanket treatments then taking the individual case and doing what's best for THEM.  | Anxiety: The only thing that i usually dislike is getting my blood pressure taken. Not only have the PA's taken incorrect readings on many occasions, but , because i had hypertension in the past (since resolved) i still fear getting a high reading. Usually my heart rate elevates a bit while i'm getting it done.  | Numeracy: After i was diagnosed with Type II diabetes (three years ago) i got little to no help from my Dr. So, i took to the net and learned everything i could about it. One thing i learned is that i can deduct the fiber count from the carb count and that will be my total net carb intake.   When i was at my Dr's office and mentioned this, she did not seem to know about it or was surprised that i knew about. "}

I think this leads them to make \"snap\" decisions without spending a lot of time considering possible alternatives; the \"easy\" answer isn't always the right one.

During the former, I sometimes wonder if my symptoms could indicate a more serious medical problem, or worry how long the condition might persist, even with treatment.

Near the end of the appointment my doctor offered me a shot of cortisone for the pain. I was surprised and promptly refused. The problem with the cortisone shot, in my opinion, is that it simply masks the pain and might lead me to overdo it during a time when I needed to rest, thus making the injury worse instead of better.

Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as \"associates\") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active \"Preferred Customers\" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand. Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9] From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c200 Best Small Companies\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13] In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20] In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22] | Anxiety: Before USANA, there was Gull Laboratories. Dr. Wentz spent 20 years developing medical diagnostic test kits designed to detect infections and certain autoimmune disorders. In his experience, Dr. Wentz led to a heightened awareness of the importance of optimal nutrition in maintaining the health of human cells. This awareness, and the clear lack of advanced nutritional support in the market led to the sale of Gull Laboratories and the beginning of a new organization. In 1992, USANA was born. USANA offers its products to customers through a process called direct selling. Direct selling is a little different from what you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re probably used to seeing. Instead of selling our products at the grocery store, products are sold directly to Associates and Preferred Customers. You may ask why our business is set up this way, and the answer is centered on opportunity. USANA has always been about more than simply selling the best wellness products in the world to great people\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094we wanted to give people the best opportunity to make their life the most successful it can be. Meaning we want people to be happy and healthy physically as well as financially. We use direct selling with the intention to help people get what they really want: freedom. Freedom to do what they want and when they want. The direct selling opportunity may not be for everyone on this planet, and that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s OK. It doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t need to be.

But we do claim the ability to give people another option to build wealth and establish financial stability, especially when they already love our product and are seeing great results.

Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[5] Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is \"variable and inconsistent\" for any condition,[6] but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.[7] In contrast, treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery."}

The difficulty occurs when, if I have a health issue, and I wish to obtain further information, I don't always have the best understanding of what is then told to me. This is perhaps due to the fact that past a point, my knowledge regarding treatment and medications is lacking, and doctors do not often have the time to explain in detail exactly what certain things do. Even when they do, they do not specify side effects of treatments. As such, I am often worried about what will happen.  | Trust in Physician: As explained before, my doctor doesn't always have the time or the commitment to explain every single little detail. Perhaps they feel it's unnecessary, and that I should trust their judgment. This is somewhat worrisome for me, as I do not know what potential issues might be going on even if the doctor does. This isn't really to degrade the work that they do, and how they treat me, since I don't believe it is done on purpose. Nevertheless, it reduces my confidence in my treatment, or any medication provided.  | Anxiety: I'm currently still young, so there's not much for me to be worried about.

Although sometimes services may be unclear, and the doctors diagnoses may bring about some confusion, I am generally able to understand and comprehend my illness and how to work other health services.

Also, the handwriting of physicians is awful and makes it really hard to understand what they are trying to tell you.  Overall, I am confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate health decisions. | Trust in Physician: It seems to be really easy to trust a physician.  I believe this way mainly because a person who has obtained that level of job and status has dedicated their entire life to getting to that point, and why would they want to be untrustworthy and not provide the best care possible if it were to put their job at risk that they have literally dedicated their entire life too.  However, many physicians may abuse their power or even be untrustworthy because they want to take advantage of you and make as much money as possible.  | Anxiety: When I visit a doctors office the thing that makes me the most anxious is worrying about getting a shot.  For my entire life, I have absolutely been terrified of needles and getting shots.  Each time I go to a doctors office this thought and idea continuously races through my mind and I find myself often sweating and shaking out of nervousness for no reason.
