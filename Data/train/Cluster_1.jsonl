If I am in pain or severe discomfort my ability to understand complex issues drops dramatically. I don't go into a doctors office often for a checkup, so most likely the reason I am there is that I am not well. This can lead to my understanding of complex issues and situations being less than great. | Trust in Physician: The way the laws are setup in this country I feel doctors have to tiptoe around certain issues. For example, If I am in severe pain I feel they would try as many remedies as possible before offering me pain medication due to the stigma the FDA puts on doctors who prescribe them. I feel like a criminal just asking for help with severe pain. If this is how they treat me with that one issue, what other issues are they making worse to protect their own license? | Anxiety: The cold sterile setting is rather unnerving, causing my anxiety levels to skyrocket. Knowing that anything I say to the doctor could be taken out of context and cost me my License/Job/Freedom due to a simple misunderstanding. The waiting can also cause stress and worry. It seems to take forever for a doctor to even make it into the room to examine you, and even longer to come back and explain what steps are next. Finally, Even when I know what is wrong, or the reason I am there and try to explain why or what helps because I've been through it before, I'm treated like an idiot or a criminal, or a faker while they order more tests to make my bill even higher.  | Numeracy: I've had issues where my tongue gets inflamed and swollen for reasons I still do not understand. Most doctors look at my tongue and focus on the top portion. I have what is called a geographical tongue. It has an odd design and looks cracked and spaced apart on the surface, kind of like the landmasses on the earth. Most doctors have not even heard of this and focus on that, as though it is part of, or the reason for the inflammation. This is one area in which I actually know more than the doctors, and frustrates me when they wont listen to my explanation. "}]}

The system seems to have been bogged down and become nothing but a business. I was diagnosed with diabetes and a couple of other conditions three years ago and my Dr's wasn't willing to discuss much with me other than wanting to throw pills at me. I refused the pills and wanted to talk about diet, exercise, carb intake, etc.  The Dr. said she couldn't discuss this and referred me to a nutritionist that wanted $1200 up front. A Dr. should know (and probably does) the very basic starting points for diabetes care.  So, this is one big reason why i don't trust the system too much. It seems there is no persol or individual care given; just a Dr. reading from a playsheet on which pill to give for which condition. She spent zero time educating me about diabetes other than a useless pamphlet. Everything i learned i did on my own. So, in summary, i don't have too much faith in the medical profession at times because they seem more geared towards business, profit and blanket treatments then taking the individual case and doing what's best for THEM.  | Anxiety: The only thing that i usually dislike is getting my blood pressure taken.

I feel this is further compounded by the general distrust of healthcare providers as of late due to news coverage, dealing with cost of services and insurance coverage, and the volume of patients versus the number of healthcare professionals to allow adequate time to get the information that one needs. These details increase the skepticism I have for specific diagnoses and treatments as it can be hard to tell if a course of action is necessary or if it is just a profit center for the doctor/hospital prescribing the treatments or diagnostics. | Trust in Physician: I trust my primary care physician for the following reasons: She is always attentive and shows interest in my line of questioning when it comes to description of symptoms, inquiries with regards to preventative maintenance (i.e. discussing future concerns based on age, family history as it relates to my current health, etc.). I never feel rushed during a routine visit when it comes to discussing concerns and overall health strategies. Overall, I feel that she cares about my well-being. My main distrust point with my primary care physician is the \"physical\" side of routine examinations. I feel like she is less comprehensive during the exam than my prior physician with regards to tests and covering all aspects of the exam. This is an additional concern now that I am older and more susceptible to common problems (e.g. enlarged prostate, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.). | Anxiety: I tend to be an anxious person in general and have a family history of high blood pressure, anxiety, etc. This often manifests in \"white coat syndrome\" when my physician or a nurse takes my blood pressure. It is usually off the charts the very first test, and sometimes it stays that way throughout the examination. This issue is further compounded as my employer/insurer has a \"wellness program\" that ties the outcomes of routine examinations with insurance premiums for the year, so there is extra incentive to maintain healthy numbers (with blood pressure being one of those numbers). For that reason, I record weekly blood pressure measurements to bring with me to examinations; unfortunately, my normalized recordings are not the ones that make it \"into the record\" for the wellness visit numbers... | Numeracy: I had a friend/coworker who had a peculiar change in some patterns that I noticed. He was using the bathroom more often and constantly refilling his water bottle throughout the day.

From the google search you can find actual medical documents explaining certain things, or just find other people like yourself suffering from the same thing who will share their experiences. Also not trying to brag but I've also been a smart person, so I find understanding things like this, isn't that tough. Generally though, I just try to make sure my Doctor and/or Nurses are fully informed of what is going on with me, and make sure to ask any questions I have. | Trust in Physician: I generally trust my primary care physician because outside of the fact that he's gone to school for a long time to be a medical professional and knows a heck of a lot more than me, he also seems like a good person, who actually cares about his patients.

Not really anything in particular but that something will require some surgery or a massive change in lifestyle. I always think about having cancer, or how scared I would be if I had to undergo a major surgery.

Initially we both thought it was bronchitis as I also had trouble breathing. After inhalers and steroids didn't help, we thought it might be heartburn, as I've had history of acid reflux and stomach issues. So after being on prilosec for a bit, I noticed I still had the burning in my chest. It was then I noticed that it occurred when my heartrate went up. So after informing my Doctor of this, we knew it was heart related, and pin pointed the issue. "}]}

I am sure the fact that I am a psychologist (PhD) does not hurt. It is also helpful that my wife is a doctoral-level nurse with 46 years of experience. When I need to select a specialist, I rely entirely on here, as she can learn in 5 minutes what would take me much longer. Who would know best about which doctor to select than a nurse with access to other nurses who know. | Trust in Physician: We selected our primary care physician based on a recommendation from our daughter after we moved. We have been completely satisfied with the family practice (my wife and I have different doctors in the practice). From day one, I got along well with my physician. We bonded, I think, partly because I was teaching at his alma mater (after retiring from my full-time position elsewhere). He will lay out various treatment options in a fair and unbiased way and leave the decision to me. Have never ever felt rushed. He takes the time that is necessary and we also toss in a discussion of sports, which is fun and makes me feel very comfortable (especially compared to some snooty specialists I have met over the years). | Anxiety: One incident stands out from my 67 years - my current physician said \"we\" needed to check my heart again. Turns out I had a murmur. Subsequent tests revealed a mitral valve problem, which will be corrected via robotic surgery. That was scary for me and still is as the surgery has not been scheduled. Generally, I am somewhat apprehensive concerning new complaints (e.g, a mole). Part of my anxiety is related to having seen family members suffer with various diseases. For example, my father died of cancer at age 40 (I was 11). My mind tends to go to \"cancer\" when I have an otherwise unexplained pain. Generally, however, I find the typical examination to be quite routine and not anxiety inducing (except in the circumstances i have outlined above). | Numeracy: I have been on clonazepam for years (for insomnia). Due to a mix-up, the prescription lapsed. Due to the fact that I had been on the drug for so long, my body experienced withdrawal. It was strange that I needed to hold onto the wall of the shower to take a shower. Fortunately, I have not had a similar problem. Got to the doctor asap and got the prescription re-issued.

I like to ask pertinent questions and try to challenge the doctor when i am experiencing an illness, and usually by the time i am talking to a doctor i have a list of questions i have derived from my own research before the appointment, many times my guess to the diagnosis proves to match that of the doctor. Sometimes even when the doctor disagrees and offers his own diagnosis in the end my guess proves to be correct after some trial and error.   | Trust in Physician: I fully believe she is doing her best, The current health care system piles workloads on top of the short supply of doctors. Due to the high workload and the short amount of time available for each patient they are not nearly as thorough as one would like. Also due to time constraints and information sharing problems they are almost never up to date on your files and past Labs, ext. They put out health fires but do little to promote general good health and long term goals. I also feel there is a long gap between current medical research and what is being practiced at the physician level, i believe in the worst cases there are old doctors practicing the medicine they learned in college, when 30 years of new science is being ignored.  | Anxiety: I don't feel a lot of these emotions. I usually am a pretty calm, cool, and collected person that tends not to make mountains out of mole hills. Due to the good fortune of never having a whole lot of serious health problems, my anxiety around doctors is pretty low, i'm not scared of needles, i believe in science and most of western medicine. I do experience some anxiety when waiting for test results, especially for serious things HIV, Hepatitis, Ect. I feel annoyance sometimes at having to wait so long in the waiting rooms, and do get a bit nervous about actually contracting diseases or sicknesses from waiting rooms and hospital lobbies.  | Numeracy: My knowledge on health and Medical issues is really only valuable to one person, me. I know how i feel, i know how i don't feel, I have a vested interest in my health and well being that encourages learning about whatever symptoms i may be dealing with at any given time, due to this i usually am pretty educated as to what i may likely have and why, or what i most likely do NOT have and why. I have noticed that doctors have seem to be thankful of this at many of my appointments and maybe even a little impressed! One time in particular i correctly diagnosed my skin condition and the doctor got it wrong in fact i had to really advocate for myself to finally get the medication that would treat the condition i was convinced i had, and finally when i saw another doctor he agreed with my diagniosis and treatment was immediately successful. The prior doctor had told me flatly that the condition i was concerned about was familiar to her and i DID NOT have it, in fact I DID! "}]}

Other than that I have no worries about visiting a doctor because I realize that I'm getting older and I'm not going to live forever. | Numeracy: I was in a group session led by a psychologist. We were discussing antisocial behavior, and like most people mistakenly do, the people in the group thought that being antisocial meant that a person dislikes socializing. I began to explain that this is a misconcecption, and that antisocial behavior actually would include a lack of empathy for others, willingness to achieve one's own pleasure at the expense of others, and an ability to be incredibly skillful at manipulating people. One one the other members of the group tried to interrupt me, but the psychologist told them that they needed to listen to what I was saying."}]}

He doesn't dance around or mince words.  I trust him for that. He's always open and gives options and opinions about the options. O respect him for that.  | Anxiety: I usually get good reports for the most part. Unknown is always worrisome. Something can happen that is unexpected and you can take things for granted. Health is always one of those things. My doctor does a good job of not keeping me in the dark about anything but you always worry about the what if. Mortality is a scary concept. Worry about what happens to my family is something goes wrong. Worry about how to pay large medical bills even though I have good insurance. No matter how prepared you think you are I don't think anything can prepare you for a very bad medical report. | Numeracy: I have several fruit allergies including bananas, kiwi, strawberries, and grapes. As a young child we did not know this. When I would eat any of these items individually I would get a mild upset stomach however one day my mom gave me bananas and kiwi cut up on a plate for a snack. After eating most of it i had shortness of breath and hives on my chest. I knew I was having an allergic reaction and needed help. I've seen an lergic reaction from my cousin who cannot have milk but one day decided to try it. I let my mom know and she gave me benadryl which countered the symptoms.  "}]}

The web is ever expanding in regards to the information available, health provider apps are becoming more robust, and I happen to work at a call center (Carenet) that works to fill gaps in the consumer healthcare experience through providing various health provider services. However, for most people, I believe they are somewhat in the dark. The doctor's offices I've always been too do a terrible job of providing knowledge unless it's a doctor trying to prove they know the jargon. Clerical staff usually seem to avoid customers at any cost and ironically have terrible customer service (for the most part). Most offices have the same 30 year old graphics of the inner ear workings alongside  numerous posters advertising designer drugs. It'd be nicer if doctors offices were part medical care, part personal medical library. Plus, nobody really likes to reach out for health/insurance related information. I think it takes the external people who have a stake in that persons health (insurance providers) reaching out with info and care plans. | Trust in Physician: It's rare I visit with a doctor that seems genuinely concerned or one that assumes his first diagnosis isn't correct. All seem to be THE expert. Some seem tired of the repetitiveness of their practice. And most seem to prescribe a specific, expensive drug, when there are other options available. | Anxiety: Probably just wondering how much it's going to cost. Everyone knows that doctors don't traditionally communicate prices before anything is said and done. Plus you pay a copay as soon as you walk in so you're kind of locked into being there anyway. I also start to worry that whatever I'm visiting for doesn't become a senseless come back again tomorrow or in 3 days so I can charge you for some more arbitrary services. Healthcare cost is so inflated and so many people are in the dark because it benefits the guys mailing out the huge bills. | Numeracy: Last week I had pink eye, I know like many, the medical term is conjunctivitis, I knew it had viral and bacterial forms (and found out allergic as well).

I worry about ever contracting a deadly disease where it is unlikely to be cured. This reason alone is why I make sure I see my doctor for my annual checkups. I want to know well in advance if I need to get something treated.  | Numeracy: When I found out that I had high cholesterol, the explanation by the doctor was quite complex.

If you want to be healthy then you need to be actively involved, not just relying on someone else for all the answers. So, while I do have great confidence in my doctor, I don't take everything he says as \"the gospel\".

Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as \"associates\") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active \"Preferred Customers\" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand. Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9] From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c200 Best Small Companies\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13] In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20] In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22] | Anxiety: Before USANA, there was Gull Laboratories. Dr. Wentz spent 20 years developing medical diagnostic test kits designed to detect infections and certain autoimmune disorders. In his experience, Dr. Wentz led to a heightened awareness of the importance of optimal nutrition in maintaining the health of human cells. This awareness, and the clear lack of advanced nutritional support in the market led to the sale of Gull Laboratories and the beginning of a new organization. In 1992, USANA was born. USANA offers its products to customers through a process called direct selling. Direct selling is a little different from what you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re probably used to seeing. Instead of selling our products at the grocery store, products are sold directly to Associates and Preferred Customers. You may ask why our business is set up this way, and the answer is centered on opportunity. USANA has always been about more than simply selling the best wellness products in the world to great people\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094we wanted to give people the best opportunity to make their life the most successful it can be. Meaning we want people to be happy and healthy physically as well as financially. We use direct selling with the intention to help people get what they really want: freedom. Freedom to do what they want and when they want. The direct selling opportunity may not be for everyone on this planet, and that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s OK. It doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t need to be.

Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[5] Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is \"variable and inconsistent\" for any condition,[6] but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.[7] In contrast, treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery."}]}

My doctor is located in a small facility so there are not that many patients he sees in a day. The care is very personal and positive. He has a way of talking to people that is very relaxing and comforting to everyone he sees. There has never been a time that I have doubted the advice or treatment he has given me. | Anxiety: I would feel anxious or worried about a doctors visit if I had a strange pain or feeling in my body that I haven't had before. Not knowing what could be the cause of the pain or illness would make me worried about what the diagnosis could be. I would slightly doubt the doctor fully understands what I am feeling and if the treatment would be the correct procedure for me. I would not feel anxious or worried if I was just going in for a regular checkup or follow up. Only when I am experiencing something I have never experienced is when I would start to worry. | Numeracy: A few years ago I had a friend that was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and she was admitted into a cancer treatment center. She was very worried about what kind of processes and procedures she would go through. I was able to talk to her about what she may experience because my father was also diagnosed with cancer and I watched him suffer through it for 6 months going through all sorts of different treatments. Because of my experience with my father I was able to talk to my friend about what she can expect and how hard the process is going to be."}]}

I took a few medical assistant classes in college because I was studying to be a medical assistant a few years ago. One of the classes was about understanding basic health information and also what some abbreviations and other important terms mean. It was a fun class. I feel that with my knowledge in this field, from school, that I have a little bit of an advantage compared to others when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. There is still some things I am probably not familiar with as I didn't get a degree in this field because I switched majors, but I feel that, overall, I have a pretty strong confidence and understanding in this area.  | Trust in Physician: I trust them most of the time but I tend to not rely too much on their answers when it comes to what medicines to prescribe. I was told by another physician that many doctors have contracts with certain pharmaceutical companies, and because of this they are persuaded to recommend that company's medications, even though they know it won't fix their pain or conditions. Since they have a contract, they are forced to push the company they have a contract with's products over others.  | Anxiety: I get most worried or anxious when I visit the doctor's office, whenever I have to take my little one to see a doctor. I get more worried because I don't take my kids to the doctor unless they are really ill and I see a lot of media talking about really dangerous, possibly deadly, flu's and other illnesses out there. I worry about these because a child can easily get these illnesses from just being at the store and someone sneezes or coughs. They can even get sick if someone coughed on an item in the store and I touch it and then hold my kids. Being a parent is already worrying but having to worry about their health whenever something like this arises, is very stressful and irritating because I tend to get really antsy and nervous while waiting for the doctor's diagnosis. I had to take my daughter to the ER a few times because she had a high fever temperature, and at the time there was a big outbreak of the flu that was nationwide and causing deaths for some young kids and the elderly. Because of this reason, I decided to take my daughter to the doctor to make sure she was alright. She ended up being fine but just the information on the news and the media and her being sick just made the whole situation nerve wrecking.  | Numeracy: An experience I had that showed my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I took my son to the doctor's office. I had remembered reading about certain signs the body gives away that are an indication of other issues during my studying in the medical field. My son was having a high fever and sweating a little and I figured he was teething because he was also drooling. Sure enough, I was correct when I talked to the doctor about it. He told me that I was absolutely right. "}]}

I also try to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables to get necessary micro nutrients. I also have cut back significantly on the amount of red meat that I eat and have replaced it with chicken or pork. Some weeks all I feel like I eat is chicken and broccoli.

However even at my young age I have spent a good amount of time in a few different hospitals. Two times because of an injury and once because of a personal health problem. I never really had any trouble understanding what exactly I needed to do in order to prevent any further injury. The doctors explained to me clearly what I needed to do and even if I didn't understand something I had no trouble asking them directly what to do. | Trust in Physician: I guess if I had to think about it, I would have a hard time coming up with a reason not to trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing him since I stopped seeing my pediatric doctor when I was a teen. He has never led me wrong or given me trouble about my prescriptions when I needed to get them filled. I also see a psychiatrist for anxiety and he provides me with the medicine needed to treat my panic disorder. I have been seeing him for over a decade and by now I only need to see him for a quick appointment once every three months because he knows me so well. | Anxiety: I already suffer from a panic disorder with anxiety so I tend to be anxious anytime I go out in public, whether it is for a doctor appointment or not. However there are certain factors that make me worry. If it is just a physical or a normal scheduled appointment then I do not worry so much. But if I am going in to get an injury looked at then I tend to worry about permanent damage. When I was a teenager I suffered rhabdomyolysis. I was very alarmed and it required a long hospital stay. I would get worried after I got out of the hospital because they were sure if  I would get full use of my limb after it healed. | Numeracy: When I was a teenager I got into a pretty terrible car accident. I was badly hurt and ended up pinned inside the car in the passenger seat. The way the metal bent in it crushed my leg. It took the first repsonders awhile to get me out of the stuck car. This meant I ended up suffering from crush syndrome or Rhabdomyolysis. This is kind of a complicated injury. It required a long hospital stay and following my release from the hospital I had to do physical therapy in order to completely rebuild the muscle I had lost in my leg. During this time I was seeing multiple doctors for various problems caused by the injury. I had to  ask a lot of questions in order to find out the best way to treat the pain I was suffering through."}]}

I'm wary of doctors and I think people give them too much credit in their ability to diagnose people and prescribe the right medications. Mostly I like to have raw test results and with that I can research on my own and try to understand how to reverse engineer a physical problem I'm having and why it occurred. The body is very mechanical in nature and as such, most problem arises for very good reason. We're a product of evolution so it's best to look at our distant ancestors for clues on how to live healthily and without ailment. | Trust in Physician: Really they are just humans like everyone else. They chose a career path, went to university for many years and got a job in the industry. How much they actually consolidated from their education is questionable. Often times it seems they're doing a lot of common sense work or things that a layman could figure out himself if he had access to the equipment and the internet. You also have to question if they have ulterior motives or reason to push medication that may not be the most advantageous. Their education is very very narrow as well, they don't often know much about natural medicine or even things like paleo diets or aspects/principles of primal living. I have to question what kind of person these doctors are and whether they even value their lives themselves because stepping back it looks like they slaved away at school just to become a doctor and deal with sick people all the time. A life like that would be miserable to me, so I wonder if some doctors even care about anything they are doing or if they are following a path for money or to impress others.  | Anxiety: I worry that they may try to push a drug on me that will end up hurting me or ruining my life. Of course, I'm very resistant to that and I would reject anything that I couldn't research before I took it. I just feel like I have to keep my guard up and make sure that I'm doing what's right for me in my understanding of things, regardless of what the doctor wants.  | Numeracy: When I have a headache or a sickness of some sort, I used to take ibuprofen or other painkillers like that. For the past couple of years when I get a headache or feel rough I will just drink lots of water and take it easy. I find that when I run a fever and leave a headache alone, I will usually get well much faster and even have a feeling in my body the next day like my body is no longer fighting something. I've come to feel like the pain you during sickness is literally the thing that's gonna defeat the virus and make you feel better sooner, and recently I've been around lots of sick people and haven't been sick in over a year. I feel that I've challenged my immune system like it's naturally supposed to be challenged, and strengthened it as a result. "}]}

On my own, I was able to figure out that diverticular disease was leading me to experience eventual high blood pressure, and that it got worse the more that I ate, so I could avoid this by fasting when I began to have these kinds of symptoms. That's more than the doctors figured out, maybe I should be a doctor."}]}

Overall, I am confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate health decisions. | Trust in Physician: It seems to be really easy to trust a physician.

The difficulty occurs when, if I have a health issue, and I wish to obtain further information, I don't always have the best understanding of what is then told to me. This is perhaps due to the fact that past a point, my knowledge regarding treatment and medications is lacking, and doctors do not often have the time to explain in detail exactly what certain things do.

A few years ago I experienced severe pain in my feet that lasted for weeks. I looked up the symptoms and was reasobly sure it was something called plantar fasciitis (sp?). It HURT. I went to my doctor and he agreed with my assessment. Unfortutely there doesn't seem to be an effective treatment other than stretching and not walking (or walking as little as possible) for many months to allow the muscles in the foot to heal. Near the end of the appointment my doctor offered me a shot of cortisone for the pain. I was surprised and promptly refused. The problem with the cortisone shot, in my opinion, is that it simply masks the pain and might lead me to overdo it during a time when I needed to rest, thus making the injury worse instead of better. It took over a year for the problem to go away. Even though I suffered through the pain I feel I made the right choice because the cortisone shot might have made the recovery last even longer!"}]}
