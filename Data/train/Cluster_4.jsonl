Even when doctors are not clear always clear to me, I am able to ask for more information when I feel that it is important that I fully understand what I'm told.

Consultations seem a bit short, but all in all I am typically out the door with a prescription that will  help me feel better and they always do.  I think when and if there is something of greater concern than a common cold,  he'll be more likely to spend more time to explain the condition and treatment. | Anxiety: I definitely get anxious when I visit the doctors because I feel like they will find something serious.  I tend to jump to the worst conclusion when a test result comes back and when I am asked to come in again.  I get really nervous/worried when I have to wait for those results because I often go into a rabbit hole of reading things on WebMD and other sources to find out more.  Knowing that these visits are to prevent illness from happening or help cure them only eases these worries a little.  | Numeracy: I often take my parents to the doctor because they need me to translate so when the doctor explained that he had vertigo I had to learn the maneuvers that he needed to do at home along with the medicine for him to feel better.
