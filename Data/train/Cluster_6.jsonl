I know a fair bit of terminology, symptoms, solutions, and of how the body works, but I am by no means an expert. The bureaucratic portion of the forms needed at doctor's offices were done by my guardian until I was 19. Because of this I feel that I have had very little time exposed to them, and as such need extra help usually on one or two sections, never the whole thing however. I feel it is harder to obtain than to process and understand as many doctors are very busy. | Trust in Physician: I go to my university health center currently, where I feel the credentials to be a medical professional are slightly more lax compared to a pediatrician you may go to as an adolescent or child. In my opinion the structured, budget friendly operation of a university health center is caked with many professionals screening and treating students the same for the most part. While I can rely on them for blood work, sexually transmitted disease screening, general prescriptions, and counseling services I would not go to them for diagnosis or anything major. I personally would prefer a resident at a hospital to the nurses I usually see. At some colleges it is worse than mine, some only have nurses and no licensed doctors. As such I don't really trust my doctor, but it's not awful. | Anxiety: I am always worried about two things primarily. When I enter a doctor's office, and sometimes even before, I am slowed down by the thought of the total cost of the visit. I find it very taxing to my patience that I get charged for my visit to the center, and then I get charged for my doctor's time AND THEN I get charged for my prescription. This is all of course assuming you pay the school's insurance fee which is far higher than the govt marketplace plans available to the public. The second worry I have going in is that whatever I am scheduled to have checked out will be worse than I thought. I have an acute worry that if I go check myself up the doctor will tell me oodles of things that are wrong with me, which sounds scary honestly. I suppose the second reason also ties into extra bills. | Numeracy: I once treated myself for a sexually transmitted disease by ordering antibiotics I had looked up (by affect to body region). I found ciproflaxin for my bladder and urinary tract, and I found doxycycline for my STD health. After looking up how long a trial is of each, I was able to complete two weeks of dosing both. I then paid for a std test at my University Health Center and I tested negative twice, to which I was very happy. In my opinion you don't need a doctor, it's just 99% of people (including myself) will never share the same knowledge as one and medicine in it's concentrated forms can be very hard to dose and apply to select cases. I am glad doctors are around, as anything more complicated than the pills would be beyond me."}]}
