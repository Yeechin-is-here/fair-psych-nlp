They get their degree then stop doing their job before they even have one. They can't be trusted. So even when I do get the rare chance to receive medical information, it is usually false, biased, or worthless.

Health services are then rendered based off of the inadequate information.   There's never any mainstream knowledge given to the public to help them understand how to implement knowledge to help themselves from the ground up; a perfect example of this is with nascent iodine, which helps the thyroid which is the master gland of the body responsible for balancing all other organs.   Without nascent iodine, fluoride, intentionally put in drinking water overwhelms EVERYONE'S thyroid.  But from an allopathic perspective, 'if ain't broke and the test doesn't say so, don't fix it'.  The Rockefellers taking over medicine in the 1940's and helping create the modern version of allopathic medicine is disgusting! | Trust in Physician: I don't have much trust in my former mainstream (allopathic) doctor mainly because of the way information in allopathic medicine is taught, from a top down and 'condition-osis' perspective.  There is no such thing in mainstream medicine as understanding a situation from the ground up.  Instead, a description of a condition is projected onto the patient and care is given based on that projection.  My doctor did absolutely nothing for me in regards to my scoliosis that got so bad my entire rib cage began to slip out of place.  Instead of seeing what was there, he acted on the preconceived notion of what scoliosis was and the problems it can cause. | Anxiety: The thing I am most worried about is getting sick from other people while at the doctor's office.  I usually take herbal supplements and colloidal silver to overcome this issue.  The other thing I get worried about is the doctor not listening to what I have to say and then brushing me off as it's time to go the next patient. | Numeracy: After years of going to the allopathic doctor and getting lots of tests done and very little answers, I stopped listening to mainstream medicine and started learning about naturopathic medicine.  I felt awful and had difficultly thinking clearly often.

Thankfully, I've lived a very healthy life and haven't had all that many interactions with healthcare professiols. But I owe that in part to my interest in health, exercise, and nutrition on a hobby level. I've studied a variety of health topics simply because it interests me; over the years I've read dozens of books on health and nutrition, disease, and pharmacology. I'm a curious person that likes to know how things work, and the human body happens to be one of those things I like to learn about. I read a number of health related blogs, occasiolly listen to health related podcasts, and have even dug in to scientific papers in medical jourls before. So I have much more background information than the typical person - nowhere near that of a medical professiol of course, but I can \"talk the talk\" better than most on a variety of health related topics, I believe. If anything, I'm more confused by the bureaucratic side of things. Insurance plans and coverage, law and tax related issues etc. are about as complex as the human body itself these days. I can't quite get myself as interested to learn more about that, but I know if I needed to research details of my plan or my options, I'm confident I could find and process that information too. | Trust in Physician: I don't currently have a primary care physician at the moment, though I have had a few over the years. I've generally had good experiences, but I also take modern medicine on the whole with a grain of salt. The doctors themselves I trust and believe to be good people doing what they feel is in my best interest. But I think the profession on a whole is quicker to treat symptoms than address causes, and put figurative band-aids on things by prescribing pharmaceuticals to address most things. I've persolly solved some of my own medical issues through my own research and by simply applying that knowledge to take better care of myself through nutrition and exercise. I don't think those basic things are offered up and encouraged often enough - but that may be just as much a reflection on our quick-fix society itself who wants a fast and easy way out of a problem rather than putting work in themselves. So in that case doctors are often doing what their customers want. | Anxiety: Even though I'm very healthy overall and generally feel pretty good, there's always that gging idea in the background that they may discover something seriously wrong that isn't currently presenting any symptoms. It's also just an anxious situation in general when another person you don't know well - or know at all - is examining your body and mind and peering into some persol and private things, even if you trust them to be objective and professiol about it. | Numeracy: It's less a specific experience and more a general one; about ten years ago I generally felt awful: constant aches and pains, low energy, difficulty breathing, bad mood, poor concentration, frequently sick with colds and sinus infections. It didn't take a lot of knowledge to know what was wrong - I was out of shape, had a poor diet, smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol. I set out and learned a lot about nutrition and exercise, I quit smoking and drinking, and I put a plan in place to gradually change my lifestyle in a way that was sustaible. Today I'm in perfect health, happy, energetic, focused, and haven't so much as had a sniffle in over two years."}

They charged me $350 for that information. I asked numerous questions and the doctor just didn't them and seemed more interested in getting me out of there. From that experience I took it upon myself to start researching  and learning what questions to ask and where to go that would provide adequate healthcare. The internet is great source of information and I feel I have benefited greatly from using it for answering some minor medical questions.  | Trust in Physician:  As a poor citizen of the United States I like millions of my fellow countryman probably avoid seeing doctors as much as possible. The cost of health care is insane and the treatment that is given to lower class individuals is often not very good. I can say this from first hand experience as told in my previous statement. Doctors often seem to care more about money than about the ethical side of their profession which is to help people. I feel there is a large disconnect between healthcare needs and healthcare providers in this country. Doctors taking hand outs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe their drugs is a huge conflict of interests. Healthcare should not be a for profit business but rather a human right.

We were sitting in the living room trying to decide what to order for dinner  when he started to complain about feeling dizzy. He excused himself and went to the bathroom. A few minutes later I heard a loud thud and went to go check on him. The door was open and he was having a seizure on the floor. I pulled him by the shoulders out of the small bathroom and into the larger adjacent room. I elevated his head on my knees and stuck my leather wallet between his teeth. After about ten seconds or so he calmed down. He was kind of out of it so I called an ambulance for him. He was ok in the end but is now on medication."}

When I think I need a doctor, I collect the symptoms, figure out my best guess for what's wrong with me, then go to the doctor with a careful explanation of what's wrong and what I likely need. Doing my own diagnosis to then get it confirmed by a doctor is a pain, but it has resulted in a lot better health care for me. I believe I can competently obtain and understand health information. I have also been successful in obtaining the few services I need. I make a point of trying to manage chronic conditions (such as obesity and obesity-related issues) without pharmaceuticals. Drugs, in my experience, are best used for acute problems. Change in behaviors, such as eating, are usually necessarily for chronic problems. | Trust in Physician: I find most doctors I have dealt with to be very rushed. If I explain something poorly, they get the wrong idea and prescribe the wrong treatment. They don't have enough time to do good diagnosis. So I think the doctors are good people. I also think they don't have enough time to do their jobs well. Likely, they may not be as up-to-date as they need to be with medical science. | Anxiety: I go to the doctor when I am sick. I have never been for a wellness check or a physical. So I am already in at least some discomfort. I just want the problem to go away. Being sick in a place with other sick people is not comforting at all. I just want an answer. I know that the course of drugs will take a week or longer to really start working. So it all takes so long. | Numeracy: In 2013, I went deaf in one ear after blowing my nose. I waited a week to see if it would get better. It didn't. I realized the cause was actually an infection I had had a decade earlier that never completely went away. A small participle of infection had remained in my sinuses for a decade, then moved when I blew my nose. If I hadn't figured that out, and relied upon a doctor to figure it, I might have have had the infection inside my ear pop my ear drum or worse."}

It seems as though many doctors rush through without properly analyzing the situation, or push for the more costly of treatments. Medicine has taken quite a plunge in recent years, and the Hippocratic Oath does not mean what it once meant.  | Anxiety: There is a lot of anxiety simply in not knowing for sure if your specific doctor (or your doctor that day) has your best interest at heart. They could be having a bad day, and overlook a serious problem. They could not take your truthful complaints serious, and give you a false clean bill of health.

For one specific example, I will talk about injections.

I feel the training they received from medical schools is geared towards treating symptoms and prescribing medications and not curing the issue. This would be due to Pharmaceutical industry having such a firm holm on lobbying the medical education system. Doctors need funding and will do what is needed or asked in order to get said funding. It is a business and that means the end user/patient is not always going to be the focus of concern. | Anxiety: Usually I get worried because the outcome is unknown and I am not sure what is going to happen. I think alot of this fear is due to not wanting to have some major medical issue come about such as cancer or other very prominent diseases. Also it is not somewhere you go very often and is usually associated with death, illness and pain so these places are naturally scary to someone who doesnt go often or is awaiting a bill of health. Also the cost is another concern and can cause stress in someone who visits because something simple can still be expensive.  | Numeracy: One time along time ago when I was a little kid I had to go to the doctor for measles and the doctor thought it was chicken pox but I knew it wasn't so I explained what I knew and how I knew it and why so we could get the correct diagnosis.

There is very little that I read aside from articles on physics that I have difficulty understanding. | Trust in Physician: In general, when dealing with a physician, I find that they are blatantly unconcerned with the welfare of their patients up to the point at which they have concerns about legal liability. The vast majority of physician are running assembly line medical practices and are far more concerned about how many patients a day they can move through their office in much the same way that servers in high-volume restaurants are concerned about how many tables they can move during their shift: It is the attempt to /appear/ to care rather than actual concern for the person who is being cared for. That said, I have been fortute enough to have experiences with truly professiol doctors who I often describe as being scientists rather than simply being a part of the medical industry, \"machine,\" so to speak. The pediatrician for my children is a remarkable man who is often willing to spend thirty minutes with each of my children making sure that they have no troubles and beyond that even longer discussing any concerns I have about my children's health. When one of my children needed a fairly minor surgery I was just overwhelmed by the doctor he recommended for it. He was intelligent, concerned, professiol, and not rushed. He was clearly very busy, but he was willing and able to discuss all of my concerns. All things considered, the majority of doctors are not professiols. The professiols are few and far between and rarely encountered in a random selection of doctors. | Anxiety: The lack of concern for my health commonly demonstrated by the doctor. The assumption that I am an ignorant person without the capacity to understand what is being said to me.

It's all paid for, legal.\" Yes, this is a real event.) | Numeracy: I'm not really terribly interested in \"wet\" sciences.

If I'm unable to ask directly, I'll do some researching on it to see if I can figure it out and then if I'm still not sure I'd ask her. | Trust in Physician: I haven't seen a doctor in over a year; I had to have stitches in my arm due to an accident. I'll use that experience to explain here. The doctor I saw was very trustworthy, in my view. The first thing he did when he saw me - before he even said a word to me - was put on gloves and poke/prod a lipoma near my eye. I had seen my doctor about it years previous so I knew it wasn't anything to be concerned with, but having a doctor who goes \"hey, this guy is here for stitches.. but I'm going to take a brief moment and check out this other thing that I'm not even going to put on the record\" really made me feel as if he was looking out for me. I really appreciated that. When we got to looking at my arm, he explained how I was lucky because if the cut had been just a small amount deeper I'd need surgery (of course today I couldn't use the terminology that he did, but at the time I fully understood everything he was saying -- if you're a redditor, it was very ELI5). However, when speaking with my normal doctors.. sometimes it seemed as if they weren't really paying attention to what I was saying. For example, when I was in the military I told my primary care physician that it didn't matter what time I would lay down, I could not go to sleep. His response to me was \"go to bed earlier\". He eventually sent me to see the base psych and I was given medications that helped. | Anxiety: How invasive things can be. That's what prevents me from going most of the time. I'd like to be able to discuss things with a doctor remotely (say, online) and then if a more invasive visit is needed we could arrange for a face-to-face.  | Numeracy: There's not too many to list for me.

Anything that makes me worry about dying is worrisome. | Numeracy: I had pains in my chest in the heart area so I went to the clinic and they said it was because I was very overweight. I was actually 250 lbs-80 lbs overweight. I was very scared and asked them to check for blood clots around the heart. They put me on high blood pressure medication and told me to lose weight. The chest pains subsided but I still have a lot of weight to lose."}

I can convey this on the new patient or similar forms so the doctor can get my background.  I try to ask questions of the doctor when he comes up with a recommended treatment plan.  I use email correspondence with my doctor to follow up on any tests or labs. I primarily use Kaiser for my health care which stores all my medical records for easy access to any doctor.

They can order new tests and/or labs easily which can often be done in the same facility.
