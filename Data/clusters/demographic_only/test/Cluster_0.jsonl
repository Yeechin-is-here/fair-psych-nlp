After eating most of it i had shortness of breath and hives on my chest. I knew I was having an allergic reaction and needed help. I've seen an lergic reaction from my cousin who cannot have milk but one day decided to try it. I let my mom know and she gave me benadryl which countered the symptoms.  "}]}
