If I ever have any questions, I make sure to ask either a health professional, someone who has personal experience with what I am inquiring about, or check online for further explanations/information. I have a personal interest in health care (i.e., taking proper care of myself and others as well as attempting to understand things that I may hear about and could be something of use in the future). Both my father and brother work in the medical field and I actively listen(ed) when they share what they know. My educational background is primarily in Psychology, but I have taken a few medical courses as well. I feel that having a good understanding of how the human body works is important and know that, if something is ever slightly difficult to understand on my own, I can find answers somewhere. | Trust in Physician: I do not have a primary care physician, however, I did have to go to a doctor recently (possible kidney stones). He was a good doctor who, although busy, took the time to listen to my concerns and symptoms while keeping a \"playful/positive\" attitude. He treated me as though I was perfectly competent in my descriptions/concerns and, while listening to me describe my symptoms, stated what possible things could be causing my symptoms, and finally what he thought it was most likely to be. He was genuinely concerned about my comfort (I was in extreme pain...but I was a champ) and wanted to make sure the pain levels would be decreased before I left the office. He sent me to another doctor for a CT scan and, after I explained I don't have health insurance, made sure that he found the best payment options/route for what I needed done as opposed to just charging me one set rate. I trusted his opinion and appreciated his compassion and humor. In general, this has been my experience with most doctors...busy, but compassionate. | Anxiety: When visiting a doctor's office, the thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is the wait between the time that I check in and the time the doctor actually can see me and uncertainty regarding how much the visit is going to cost financially. Primarily the anxiety I feel is induced by whatever ailment I am experiencing and it typically turns into both anxiety and relief....anxiety over what the doctor might diagnose (for instance, it could be the worst case scenario...though likely not) and relief knowing that someone will be able to give his/her professional opinion and action can be taken. However, for the most part, going to the doctor's office isn't anxiety inducing....just whatever symptoms I am experiencing and the possible cost to \"fix\" it. On a side note, I typically don't go to the doctor unless I am extremely concerned about whatever is ailing my body.  | Numeracy: One experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues involved a group of friends and myself hanging out. The guys in the group were being rambunctious and wrestling inside the house (something which was not recommended). At one point, one of the guys tripped and fell hitting his head on the corner of the television. It immediately began bleeding and he was unsure as to what he should do so he immediately came to me. My suggestion was to first stop the bleeding (apply slight pressure to the area), check his cognitive functioning/vision, and make sure he didn't fall asleep, and stay positive/encouraging so he would not panic. After a little while the bleeding stopped and we further assessed his state. I gave him ibuprofen and continued to monitor his state for the next couple of hours making sure that he knew we could go to the hospital if need be."}

When it comes to written documents I am giving after an appointment explaining my diagnosis, I am generally confident in my ability to understand, and that anything unclear is easily researched online if not. | Trust in Physician: I generally trust the doctors that I see because I respect their knowledge and experience. This is particularly true when I see specialists about a particular condition. I have faith when seeing a specialist that they have seen many patients with my condition and that they will be able to quickly find a cure or method to manage the condition. I also try to use this opportunity to ask general questions about the condition to them, which I believe is more informative than if I searched online on my own. | Anxiety: I am most worried about examinations which may be physically painful or uncomfortable, as this has necessarily been a common occurrence for me lately. I am also a reserved person, and therefore may feel physically or even emotionally vulnerable in these moments.

This was due in part to having researched them in the past, both in how they relate to poor diet and how they can be caused or exacerbated by anal sex. I already knew going in that these would take a long time to heal, so I didn't expect a quick recovery. Furthermore, I was able to ask better clarifying questions during my appointment due to my prior knowledge, which helped me understand what I needed to do as well as diagnose the cause more quickly."}
