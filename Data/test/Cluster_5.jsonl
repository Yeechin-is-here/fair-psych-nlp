I've always been a rather sheltered and dependent person, so depending on the importance, I'd prefer it if someone were to go over it with me or walk me through it to minimize errors. I don't do anything like this that often either, so I'm sure if I had more practice, I'd be all right on my own. | Trust in Physician: I haven't been to my primary care physician in a while due to no longer having health insurance, but I'll do my best to explain. I typically take good care of myself and try to avoid going to the doctor's office at all costs. The main reason that I would visit her is because of my IBS, which is something that she also suffers from, so I know that she understands what I'm going through. More generally, you never feel like you're being rushed. She always listens to whatever you need to say about your issues, no matter how long you go on about it. | Anxiety: Even though it hasn't been diagnosed, I'm certain that I've got some form of an anxiety disorder, so I'm pretty much always on edge when visiting the doctor's office. I'm a pretty modest person (and being asexual probably doesn't help this), so anything that involves getting a little too touchy-feely makes me extremely uncomfortable. For instance, I know that I should really visit a gynecologist or the like, but the thought of it freaks me out too much. I actually took far longer than I should have to go to the doctor about my IBS before I knew what it was, because I was afraid that I'd have to have a colonoscopy or something similar (as mentioned earlier, I was fortunate that my doctor also suffers from it, so as soon as I started talking about my symptoms, she knew exactly what it was). | Numeracy: Apologies in advance if this isn't exactly the type of experience that you're looking for, but it's the only thing that I can think of that somewhat relates. Whenever I run across something that I don't know about (especially a health issue), I typically try to do as much research on it as I can. As mentioned before, I suffer from IBS. I tried to do what research that I could on my own, but I eventually had to cave and go to the doctor when it didn't seem to get any better (it's a good thing that I did, because I likely also had a stomach ulcer). Anyway, fast forward about half a year later, and it seems that my IBS is getting worse and my medicine doesn't seem to be helping that much. I go to the doctor again to get a different medicine, which also doesn't seem to be doing much good. In the meantime, I've been keeping a food journal and doing more research on my own. After a couple of months of pain, I figure out the problem--I've developed fructose malabsorption. After cutting out soda and other things high in fructose, the problem is as fixed as it can be."}]}

I read quite a bit in general, and do so at a practiced leisurely pace to ensure I process what I am reading. Medical information especially is extremely important to understand everything pertaining to what you're getting involved in the moment you step into a doctors office or hospital. Health decisions are some of the most important decisions we make in our lives, considering these decisions literally do directly effect our life and livelihood.

I am still young and health is important at every age. | Trust in Physician: It's not my primary care physician in particular that I distrust, It's the fact that doctors are people too and anybody can get lazy and careless at times in their profession or simply be having a bad day. I mildly mistrust all doctors until I have reasonable proof not to do so. There are problems with how the medical field is run in this country and I'm sure there are doctors out there that disgree with things they must comply to on a daily basis which can be disheartening in the longrun. Most doctors have the ability to be great, but I believe it's harder than it has to be. Overall though, I do trust my doctor because I have faith in the decision I made to choose them as my pcp based on my experience with them.  | Anxiety: Most of the time myself and many people visit doctor's offices is because there is something wrong, so being examined for the problem you've been having can make you slightly anxious or worried of the outcome of the examination.

She was 75 years old and I expl to the doctor that based on what I read online the chances of her going into a diabetic coma were almost none. Based on what I read there is a little chance of a person with a high glucose level who is over the age of 70 going into a diabetic coma almost non existing and also she was going to die anyways, the tumor was not operable and it did not respond to radiation."}]}
