My mind goes to a bad place for a bit thinking of the what ifs and the problems I have been having. My grandfather died of cancer 2 years ago because his doctor wasn't thorough and didn't catch the cancer at all. My mind always goes to that instance and I wish it didn't. I don't feel a ton of anxiety but it's enough to make me think back to what happened to my grandfather. I don't want that to be me. | Numeracy: I was studying to be a massage therapist and a client came in with serious back problems. They asked me what muscles I would work out and if I could help address the issue and possible fix it. I had to learn anatomy to be able to work on clients so I worked on a specific muscle group I had learned about in class and they felt much, much better after I had worked on them. It definitely helped learning anatomy, otherwise I would be of no help to anyone."}]}

I know that emergencies come up which throws the schedules off, but I believe that keeping patients informed is important.

I had multiple exploratory surgeries to remove the cysts.  The cysts came on a cycle of approximately every five years, I would have surgery every five years to have them removed.  Finally after quite a bit of research and discussion with my doctor it was decided to do a partial hysterectomy and remove my uterus to see if that would break the cycle.  this worked for ten years, at that time I started getting the cysts on my ovaries again, with the pain being 75% of the month.  it was decided that my ovaries needed to come out to prevent this from happening.  By my doctor being informed on what the best course of action was for me I was able to keep my ovaries for a longer period of time, therefore not having to take synthetic hormones until absolutely necessary.

Before working here, I worked at a hospital for 10 years and then at a physician's office for a couple of years. I also take yearly courses in the laboratory science to satisfy my CEU requirements for my state laboratory license.   I also feel very confident that I can make appropriate decisions about what services I may need.  If there is anything I don't understand about a condition I have the knowledge to search for the appropriate information and the mental capacity to sift through to gather correct information.   | Trust in Physician: My primary care physician is a very nice young woman and I have been to her several times over the past years.  She has always told me what is necessary and I have never sensed any dishonesty in speaking with her.  She has told me the truth about everything I have asked about. She also listens to what I told her I thought was the problem.  She has agreed with me on many occasions. She has referred me to another physician when she thought it was beyond her scope.  I have asked for prescriptions that I felt would be necessary for me and she has complied and agreed with me.  She is young and I feel she has the most current knowledge possible.  I have never looked at her as inexperienced.  She has always presented herself very professiol and she presents herself as very knowledgeable.  In conversations with her, she IS actually knowledgeable.  | Anxiety: I don't like it when the physician doesn't know what is wrong and has to refer me to a specialist. For example, I asked my physician \"Why can't you just do the biopsy?\"  She said she didn't have the resources in the office.  It makes me very anxious when I have to make an appointment with another physician and wait while I don't know what is wrong.  This has happened to me in the last year.  Then for the BIGGEST thing that makes me anxious is worrying if my insurance, UHC, is going to try to pull some nonsense to get out of paying for something.  They actually did this, they made every nonsensical excuse not to pay the physician for the biopsy.  The physician's office eventually wrote off the expense, but that is not fair to them.  SO, my insurance trying to get out of paying is what makes me most anxious.   | Numeracy: I was having mouth ulcers, interrupted sleep, hot flashes and irregular periods about a year ago. I immediately knew it was a hormone imbalance and the start of perimenopause.  I knew that I needed to go to the physician and get a hormone replacement therapy if I was going to start feeling more normal.  I went to a gynecologist since they are more equipped in handling this type of problem.  I know that for heart and bone health it is important that I take some kind of hormone replacement because Osteoporosis does run in my family.  I also knew I needed a supplement with not only estrogen but progesterone.  So I was sure to notice the physician gave me the right prescription.  And to save money I also knew that I could cut the pill in half since the best therapy is the lowest dose that relieves symptoms.  I cut the pills in half and they seem to be working fine and have relieved the menopausal symptoms. "}]}

His PDR was no help to him, and he finally asked me what was usually prescribed for me, and wrote the prescription after again checking the PDR for correct dosage by weight, after asking me my weight. I was 20 at the time. Want more? Despite foreknowledge of both grandmothers dying of uterine hemorrhage and special care being taken for my first two deliveries, I suffered a uterine hemorrhage with my third child and \"died\" and I'm here only because I responded positively to resuscitation. Further idiocy? Second hand smoke was disproved in 1999, but they keep beating that dead horse.

Well, spouse did pay for it all financially, so it balanced (smile). This is just one example of many from also being the eldest of 10 children.  "}]}

I can think things through but have problems remembering so I try to go to appointments with notes that I type up in advance to make sure things don't fall through the cracks.   I can then make handwritten notes as the doctor or nurse answers the pre-typed questions.   The times I run into trouble is when I don't bring / take notes as I can easily forget some of what was said if I count on memory alone.  That is why I prefer to get written information that I can review slowly and refer back to as needed. | Trust in Physician: My PCP means well (and I do not at all mean that as a sarcastic comment) but like most PCPs in the days of managed care plans, he is overworked and cannot take the time to really get to know each patient thus some critical things can fall through the cracks unless I make a point of bringing them up to him.  Otherwise, he just orders blood work every three months and bases his whole appointment with me on the bloodwork results instead of, for example, looking at the fact that as a 60 year old woman with severe osteoporosis (due to my osteogenesis imperfecta) I am supposed to be having annual bone density scans.   I have to bring up things like bone density scans, mammograms, etc. to him myself because if it is not a blood test result, it will fall through the cracks.   In his defense, I will say, he orders thorough blood tests, goes over the results with me to make sure I understand them and when I do bring up something outside of the blood tests, he listens and works with me on it.  He is a good doctor, just overworked.  I don't trust him to be aware of my health conditions.  I do trust him to work with me when I remind him of what is going on with me. | Anxiety: The battle I sometimes have to have to get them to use a manual blood pressure cuff on me instead of an automatic one.   As previously mentioned, I have severe osteoporosis due to osteogenesis imperfecta.   It is possible for the automatic one to tighten so much that it can literally fracture my arm.  Thus as the nurses' handbook for OI states, a manual blood pressure cuff should be used on folks like me.    Doctor's office staff are not used to patients coming in and insisting on the use of a manual cuff.   I don't look forward to having to go through that each time. | Numeracy: I have to go back to my osteogenesis imperfecta again as having lived with it for over 60 years now, it is what I know best about my own body.   It takes very little for me to fracture. At times I get what are called spontaneous fractures.   Medical professionals who are not particularly familiar with OI can't believe how little it takes for me to get a fracture nor do radiologist always understand that what I often get are tiny hairline fractures which are hard to see.  Thus I can be diagnosed as not having a fracture when I actually do.  I have to know enough to listen to my own body in those cases."}]}

I will generally do internet research on my own before seeing a doctor so I have a better understanding.  I generally do not need any assistance.  If I have questions I try to remember or write them down to ask the doctor.  Sometimes the doctors are too rushed and busy during an appointment.  That is very frustrating.  I am the type of person who wants to understand and ask a lot of questions.  At the same time, I am very intelligent and understand things quickly, as well as do my own research ahead of time in order to not waste time during the appointment.  Nevertheless, the doctors many times do rush me or make me feel that they are not interested in answering my questions.  The scariest thing is when they do not have the answers to my questions or are dismissive of my concerns or when I am using supplements that work that they have never heard of. | Trust in Physician: My doctor is intelligent and easy to open up to for the most part.  But sometimes I feel rushed.  Sometimes I feel she is a bit condescending or quick to jump to conclusions.  I generally feel she is not as thorough as I would like.  I supplement the visit with a lot of internet research.  I mainly go to her for basic checkups.  It's very hard to find a doctor who you really like, who listens to you, who doesn't rush you, who you trust, who you feel comfortable talking openly with, who is non judgemental, who takes your insurance and continues to take your insurance, who gives you good answers to your medical problems, who has a competent and caring staff.

Or some expensive testing procedure that of course insurance won't cover.  Money and pricing is always a concern with doctor visits.

Many times I feel violated for having to sign away all my rights in the paperwork.  And the office staff is usually rude and abrupt and treats you less than humanely. | Numeracy: I have been getting migraines for years.  I did some research and was disappointed to find that they don't know exactly what causes them and that there is really no cure.  I started taking excedrin regularly.  I also had a facial intense pulsed light ipl treatment that made me have migraines nearly every day.  I went to the chiropracter because I though my posture and neck alignment may be contributing to neck tension and pain.  This could be leading to frequent headaches.  I wanted to continue with the chiropracter but I cannot at this time due to money issues.  I started getting what I believe were intenstinal ulcers from the excedrin, particularly the NSAIDs.  It put me in extreme pain and cramping for days which I could not get rid of.  I went to see an emergency doctor who gave me pills to stop the cramps in my intenstine.  My sister had the same issue a few years later.  I found out my whole family gets migraines at a family reunion.  I started doing more research and found out inflammation could be a cause.  I started taking turmeric supplements for inflammation.  Within a month I had significantly fewer migraines and headaches.  Now I recommend it to all the women I meet who have migraines, many many women do."}]}
