I'll use that experience to explain here. The doctor I saw was very trustworthy, in my view. The first thing he did when he saw me - before he even said a word to me - was put on gloves and poke/prod a lipoma near my eye. I had seen my doctor about it years previous so I knew it wasn't anything to be concerned with, but having a doctor who goes \"hey, this guy is here for stitches.. but I'm going to take a brief moment and check out this other thing that I'm not even going to put on the record\" really made me feel as if he was looking out for me. I really appreciated that. When we got to looking at my arm, he explained how I was lucky because if the cut had been just a small amount deeper I'd need surgery (of course today I couldn't use the terminology that he did, but at the time I fully understood everything he was saying -- if you're a redditor, it was very ELI5). However, when speaking with my normal doctors.. sometimes it seemed as if they weren't really paying attention to what I was saying. For example, when I was in the military I told my primary care physician that it didn't matter what time I would lay down, I could not go to sleep. His response to me was \"go to bed earlier\". He eventually sent me to see the base psych and I was given medications that helped. | Anxiety: How invasive things can be. That's what prevents me from going most of the time. I'd like to be able to discuss things with a doctor remotely (say, online) and then if a more invasive visit is needed we could arrange for a face-to-face.  | Numeracy: There's not too many to list for me. I tend to defer to someone else. However, there have been various times where I've commented (ie: on social media) with my understanding of issues that I have experience with. For example, a couple years ago I explained to a worried young male what a varicocele was."}]}

I read and write better than most people I know and have a good vocabulary. But I don't have a lot of specialized medical knowledge, so sometimes I do feel like I don't have all the information I need to make a good decision or to understand what a doctor tells me. I think compared to most other people who aren't doctors or nurses, I'm doing well, but there are still a few times when I wish I were more confident. | Trust in Physician: I trust doctors, if not to know what's best for me all the time, at least to have a much better shot at it than I do. But I don't necessarily trust them to have the same priorities I do. That doesn't even necessarily mean that I don't trust them to put my health as the top priority - sometimes that's not MY top priority. I'm still kind of ticked off at a doctor who ordered $1000 worth of blood tests for PCOS, which it turned out I don't even have and which was nowhere close to his specialty (he was a psychiatrist!). Yes, there was a small chance I had PCOS. Yes, if I had had it, there would have been a small chance of heart problems (all the other symptoms were things I considered either no big deal like hair, or actually beneficial, like amenorrhea and infertility). But good God, $1000! Insurance wouldn't even cover it! I could NOT convince that man that I was poor. So I no longer trust him to make decisions for me, because we don't see eye-to-eye about what's important. | Anxiety: I guess there's always the back-of-the-mind fear that the doctor will find something wrong. That's not usually a huge concern for me, though, because I've always been quite healthy aside from my weight, which I'm working on. Mostly I'm just anxious because there's nearly always SOMETHING uncomfortable in a doctor's visit. Taking off more clothes than I'd like to, or painful examitions (and I have a VERY low pain threshold - I consider those blood pressure cuffs painful), or being told yet again that I'm overweight as if I couldn't see that for myself. | Numeracy: A few weeks ago, my brother hit his head at work. He'd had several mild concussions as a child and pretty much self-diagnosed himself as having another one this time. (Yes, that's wildly irresponsible. Yes, he should have gone to the doctor. You know what, tell it to fucking Nikki Haley because it's her fault he's not insured.) He did some research about concussion and painkillers and said he needed to take something other than Excedrin, preferably Tylenol. He was pretty upset because we didn't have any Tylenol and his head hurt. So I realized that often, different me brands of the same medicine will have similar mes, and another painkiller that ended in \"ol\" might have the same active ingredient as Tylenol. I looked up the active ingredients online and checked the bottle to make sure, and then gave him a Midol from my supply. So most of the medical knowledge in that scerio came from him, but I was the one who realized that Midol would probably help and did the research to verify it."}]}

He was also not truthful about the surgical options available either. We confirmed this first through internet research, then with a leading heart surgeon at a highly-rated cardiac hospital. The end result was that my mother did not need heart surgery at all and after twice-yearly echo cardiograms with a different cardiologist, still does not require it.
