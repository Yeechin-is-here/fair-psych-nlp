As a result of being told this, I would not allow my children to flush the toilet until they were past the age of 10 so I could check their stools each time they went. If they had a loose stool, I varied their diet. If their stool appeared hard, I varied their diet. Also, when they had too much energy, rather than assume they needed medication, I had them exercise - it worked every time. And one other instance, my younger son was slow to talk. An in-law suggested something was wrong. I explained he had no problem communicating what he wanted or needed and, thus, nothing was wrong. I was right; she was wrong."}

She also gets my age wrong every time.  I only go to her for referrals.  She is at an age where I think she needs to retire and every time I have been there I never see any patients in the waiting room.  Her online reviews are also terrible.  | Anxiety: When I see one of my specialists I am afraid she will find that something is wrong and that I will require surgery.

I have an anxiety disorder as well so that makes the experience even worse. | Numeracy: I have given advice to a lot of friends who have mental illnesses since I suffer from depression and anxiety disorder.
