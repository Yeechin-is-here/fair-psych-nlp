I always feel rushed at the doctor's office. I get nervous and forget to ask the important questions I should ask. I get my blood taken every 3 months because I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I take medications to control these conditions and both are hereditary based. My understanding is just okay at best.

For example, I suffer from depression and anxiety and all she does is prescribe medication that doesn't work. Sometimes my anxiety is out of control and I get very little sleep. I have a medication that is not working for me and she just keeps adjusting the dosage and it still doesn't help. This has been going on for over a year. She takes my high blood pressure and cholesterol very serious but doesn't give me much help other than a diet and exercise and medicine.

I am nervous when I go there no matter what. It doesn't matter if I have a current health issue or not. Getting my blood taken amps up my anxiousness though because I am afraid of needles.

At times I feel like I am being rushed and things aren't explained to me the way I need. I can fill out forms, but it seems they aren't read by the doctor. When given a diagnosis, I have to do the research to find out exactly what it means. I can say that my PCP does a better job than my other doctors in taking time to listen to me.

First thing she does is read the nurse's notes of why I'm\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u008b there and the notes made at my previous visit. I get nervous any time I have to see any of my doctor's, but she and her staff treat me with respect and dignity which usually calms me.

The doctors that rush, specifically my pain management physician, and don't seem interested in listening to me leave me feeling misunderstood.

There is a lake on property that we walk to often. One day we arrived at the lake and there was a male resident, wheelchair bound, there. He appeared to be asleep. My mother didn't realize he was there. I immediately had concern. One of those feelings you can't explain. I decided to just keep an eye on him while we were feeding the turtles. I would look his way often and noticed he had moved his wheelchair into a different position. I continued to observe him, but I looked away for a few minutes. Next thing I know he was lying prone on the ground. It appeared that he was grabbing at a tree to pull himself up. That did it for me and I went over to offer my assistance. When I got to him he refused my help. And I realized he was using the tree to push himself to the water. He was going to commit suicide. I used my knowledge of depression (I have suffered through my own recurrent depression for 20 years) and began talking to him and listening to him all while trying to physically hold him still. I became his friend for those moments he really needed someone. I may have been the one who saved his life, but God gave me the calm and physical strength to hold him until some more help arrived."}]}

It was or could have been found in the beginning if my Dr would have listened to me and just did some bloodwork.

I found 3 blood tests that were flagged as abnormal and one was really low compared to what the reference range showed for Vitamin D and I was very deficient on paper. I told the DR my findings and he said ohhh just go out in the sun more. Well I talked to a nurse practitioner about it on a follow up appt and she put me on Vitamin D3 supplements for 3 months and I really felt so much better after my level was up. "}]}

When a medical professional gives me materials, I read and understand them just fine.  And when I have questions about my health or medical procedures, I can usually find the answers I need on the internet.  Then, if there is some question specific to only my situation, I can ask my doctor and receive a suitable response in a timely fashion.   | Trust in Physician: I trust my PCP because she is fairly thorough.

If I ask for a test or procedure, she does whatever she can to make it happen, which helps to allay my fears.  She makes appointments for me in a timely fashion, and she seems to actually care about my issues.  That's not to say she isn't usually in a hurry, but I think most doctors are because of a large patient load. | Anxiety: I guess the number one thing is fear that a routine exam or test will uncover something really wrong with me.

Needless to say, that has so far not happened.  So I think it's very important that I have the ability to access proper medical care (in the past I haven't always had the access)  to go and get checked out on a regular basis, more for my own mental peace of mind than because there is something actually really wrong with me.  Other than that, sometimes I do worry that a doctor or nurse will be judgmental and make comments to me about certain unhealthy characteristics like my weight or smoking, but that's not nearly as big a concern. | Numeracy: Recently I had a tubal ligation.  I was talking with a friend who was slightly misinformed about the potential side effects of the procedure.  Since I had recently learned a lot about it, I helped to correct her.  She stated that in most cases, the blood vessel supplying the ovary would be cut along with the Fallopian tube.  I informed her that not only was this very rare, if it did happen to someone she knew, they could probably sue for malpractice.  My doctor personally assured me, and she has done so many procedures she lost count a long time ago, she had never seen it happen where the blood vessel was cut.

I do feel that some of the answers given to me by doctors is very ambiguous and vague. I feel it's becoming more and more difficult to get a definitive answer and treatment plan by many doctors. In this way, I do find it difficult, because there seems to be a lack of concern in what I'm asking about in certain situations. I often have to rely on doing a lot of research myself, which can be difficult when trying to discern certain medical journals.  | Trust in Physician: I feel that since the practice I go to has switched/been bought by or covered by a certain medical group, the quality of care has greatly declined, and I've noticed several subtle and some not so subtle changes for the worse. I have gone in so many times trying to figure out what is causing my body some negative problems (pain, easily fatigued, etc) and I just keep getting the run around, it seems. I am considering finding a medical practice that hasn't yet been bought out or taken over by the specific umbrella medical group, which has been difficult. I don't believe that prescription drugs that just bandaid a situation are the answer. I don't like to take a bunch of Rx, and would appreciate some direction from my physicians, but haven't gotten much help in that dept. | Anxiety: For one thing, if there is the flu going around like now, I am very hesitant and anxious to go get bloodwork or general exam because I don't want to end up catching the flu from the sick people there. Beyond that, I just have had a few years recently that I feel going to the doctor is a waste of money for me, I leave with no answers, no solutions and just more broke. I have no confidence in the doctors at this juncture to at least point me in the right direction regarding my health. It is a frustration that I'm currently dealing with as a matter of fact. I personally feel (and many others in similar situations that I have talked with) feel that Novant Health, in particular, has ruined my family practice that I've gone to for decades. In recent years, it's just become a waste of money as I'm shuffled in and out after paying. That in and of itself, the lack of confidence I have now in the process, does cause me anxiety, as well as teh finances. | Numeracy: When one of my daughters was ill, I knew that she was in a medical emergency situation as her fever shot very high. Though she was an adult, I knew she was incapable of handling this herself and rushed her to the ER, which the doctors said was good and immediately gave her treatment to bring down the temp safely and quickly. I was her advocate and wouldn't stop explaining her other symptoms, which they ran extensive tests on after I insisted and found the root cause. It was at that point they were able to correctly give her the medicine to properly treat her condition."}]}
