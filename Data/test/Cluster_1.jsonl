Overall, I am pretty confident dealing with various sources of health information and services but will certainly ask or research myself for better clarity/understanding if something is unclear or I need information about how something should be properly done.  | Trust in Physician: I generally trust my doctor because they have always led me in the right direction and provided me with the best information or options in respect to my situation. I still like to do my own research as to things they say or recommend to me, but I generally trust their initial assessments. I think most doctors do really care about their patients needs instead of what is just convenient for them. | Anxiety: I feel most anxious or worried about any possible negative diagnosis or treatments that might be advised to take (especially if invasive). Just the initial feeling of not knowing what is going on or what the problem is is already enough to cause a general feeling of anxiety. Some testing (and not just treatments) are also worrisome (fear of needles... I go through it, but I still hate any type of needles/pin pricks, etc.). | Numeracy: Having to go see a specialist doctor and being able to converse quite easily with them about various conditions I had was due to research and learning as much as I could so as to have at least a general knowledge base to work with. I've also on several occasions answered some friends questions when they asked about what I think might be a problem with them, and I was either right (from having experienced the same thing myself) or was pretty close with my thoughts on the issue at hand."}

Much of the stress of dealing with a medical situation has to do with things that are not related to any ailment itself. | Trust in Physician: My physician sometimes waffles or backtracks, which causes me to suspect her judgment on occasion. She has more than once recommended a certain treatment and then at a follow-up exam, has made statements about the treatment which caused me to wonder whether she actually believed in it or not. I do realize that doctors are just people, and sometimes not even terribly intelligent or competent, so I've trained myself to expect not quite so much from them as others may.  | Anxiety: Anxiety is two-pronged, in this case: first, that the doctor may \"find something\" in my results, and second, the fact that he or she might not actually be correct about those findings. Doctors, again, are only human, and prone to mistakes or oversights. This makes all of their claims at least somewhat suspect.  | Numeracy: Several years ago I had to have a hernia repaired.

Sometimes I do need to clarify and get more information on things like, for example, diabetes and what needs to be done to control that given my risk factors. The one thing that completely flies over my head though is insurance. I can never tell if something is covered or not and it's a pain to have to try and figure that out so you don't end up paying a fortune if there is a generic that's cheaper somewhere. In my experience the Doctors and staff I've seen have always been kind, patient, and attuned to my concerns and willing to take a few minutes to explain what they suggest and why. That's really an important part because they don't need to go into all the technical details...just give me an idea of my options and a basic understanding of what they're trying to solve. | Trust in Physician: I trust my primary physician because I've seen him ever since I was an early teenager. He knows me very well and a lot of my habits both good and bad. He was critical in getting through high school and college with all the necessary vaccines and STD prevention tools, and has always been very open and engaging. It's almost like talking to an old friend where you feel like you can be yourself and open. This really helps in getting across to each other better, and allows him to more easily attune his prescriptions and medical diagnosis' to my situations. I think a lot of people tend to see their doctor as just a means to get medication when they need it, but I think a lot of people fail to realize just how beneficial it can be to have a doctor you trust and is willing to go that extra mile to help you. | Anxiety: In general, what makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when I go for a specific reason. For example, STD testing or I have something I noticed that I want to seek attention for. These are the situations that cause the most anxiety because they aren't specifically routine, but conditional. While I do have an annual physical, I know what to expect based upon historical visits, but when something unexpected occurs it could be anything from minor to severe and you just aren't aware of it. What if that rash is something more? What if that mole isn't right and I need to be referred to a dermatologist? What if that cold wont go away as fast as it should? These are the kinds of situation that cause me anxiety. | Numeracy: I'm not sure if this really counts but a while back in college I noticed that I had put on significant weight and I was more out of breath than usual. I also noticed that I became a lot more thirsty and lazy than usual so I stopped and considered my risk factors. I know that my family has a high history of diabetes and hypertension (and high cholesterol), so I took it upon myself to buy a blood pressure monitor and measure my blood pressure over a period of a week. It was not favorable, so I talked to a nutritionist and made a healthy eating plan as well as an exercise routine. By monitoring it further, I successfully decreased my blood pressure significantly and it has remained in safe levels since I have continued my routine."}

The web is ever expanding in regards to the information available, health provider apps are becoming more robust, and I happen to work at a call center (Carenet) that works to fill gaps in the consumer healthcare experience through providing various health provider services. However, for most people, I believe they are somewhat in the dark. The doctor's offices I've always been too do a terrible job of providing knowledge unless it's a doctor trying to prove they know the jargon. Clerical staff usually seem to avoid customers at any cost and ironically have terrible customer service (for the most part). Most offices have the same 30 year old graphics of the inner ear workings alongside  numerous posters advertising designer drugs. It'd be nicer if doctors offices were part medical care, part personal medical library. Plus, nobody really likes to reach out for health/insurance related information. I think it takes the external people who have a stake in that persons health (insurance providers) reaching out with info and care plans. | Trust in Physician: It's rare I visit with a doctor that seems genuinely concerned or one that assumes his first diagnosis isn't correct.

It required a long hospital stay and following my release from the hospital I had to do physical therapy in order to completely rebuild the muscle I had lost in my leg.
