Most recently I went into see him to get a small internal bump in my inner thigh examined.  After he gave me a physical examination, he determined that it was not cancerous and posed little risk as he thought it was a cyst.

I find that when I communicate clearly with him he is easy to understand and is easily able to diagnose my issue. | Anxiety: The things that make me feel most anxious at the doctor's office are a) my ability to communicate clearly the symptoms I am experiencing and how often I experience them and b) describing intimate or personal issues with female nurses and doctors.

I proceeded to not only stop the bleeding, but give him a lesson in basic first aid.  This involved methods for stopping bleeding, barriers to infection, and treatment of bruises or sprains.

Sometimes I do need to clarify and get more information on things like, for example, diabetes and what needs to be done to control that given my risk factors. The one thing that completely flies over my head though is insurance. I can never tell if something is covered or not and it's a pain to have to try and figure that out so you don't end up paying a fortune if there is a generic that's cheaper somewhere. In my experience the Doctors and staff I've seen have always been kind, patient, and attuned to my concerns and willing to take a few minutes to explain what they suggest and why. That's really an important part because they don't need to go into all the technical details...just give me an idea of my options and a basic understanding of what they're trying to solve. | Trust in Physician: I trust my primary physician because I've seen him ever since I was an early teenager. He knows me very well and a lot of my habits both good and bad. He was critical in getting through high school and college with all the necessary vaccines and STD prevention tools, and has always been very open and engaging. It's almost like talking to an old friend where you feel like you can be yourself and open. This really helps in getting across to each other better, and allows him to more easily attune his prescriptions and medical diagnosis' to my situations. I think a lot of people tend to see their doctor as just a means to get medication when they need it, but I think a lot of people fail to realize just how beneficial it can be to have a doctor you trust and is willing to go that extra mile to help you. | Anxiety: In general, what makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when I go for a specific reason. For example, STD testing or I have something I noticed that I want to seek attention for. These are the situations that cause the most anxiety because they aren't specifically routine, but conditional. While I do have an annual physical, I know what to expect based upon historical visits, but when something unexpected occurs it could be anything from minor to severe and you just aren't aware of it. What if that rash is something more? What if that mole isn't right and I need to be referred to a dermatologist? What if that cold wont go away as fast as it should? These are the kinds of situation that cause me anxiety. | Numeracy: I'm not sure if this really counts but a while back in college I noticed that I had put on significant weight and I was more out of breath than usual. I also noticed that I became a lot more thirsty and lazy than usual so I stopped and considered my risk factors. I know that my family has a high history of diabetes and hypertension (and high cholesterol), so I took it upon myself to buy a blood pressure monitor and measure my blood pressure over a period of a week. It was not favorable, so I talked to a nutritionist and made a healthy eating plan as well as an exercise routine. By monitoring it further, I successfully decreased my blood pressure significantly and it has remained in safe levels since I have continued my routine."}]}

If a battery of tests are given to me I need an explanation, not just of the normal parameters but, of how the results as a whole relate to my health.

I have bad reactions to some prescribed medications but, the doctor was not careless or incorrect in prescribing them for me.  The two bad experiences I had were; a doctor who wanted to do a surgical procedure in office with local anesthesia that, as I found out when I had it done in hospital, would have likely killed me if I had allowed him to proceed, and a doctor who took a phone call while suturing me and allowed a poorly trained nurse to finish the job. Big scar!

I fear my test results in particular after a period when I have let myself go physically or not watched my diet carefully. My particular fears are; cancer and signs of cognitive decline. My cholesterol is another concern as it is nearly always just outside the parameters and I am nearly always chided for that. I am diabetic but my A1c results have been consistently good for many years now. I dread going to the psychiatrist for anxiety meds because I really feat mental aging and there is nearly always a test for that involved with the visit. | Numeracy:  I fell and scratched my wrist in my front yard one morning. When I put my hand in my pocket about 2 hrs later I was shocked by the pain from my hand. My fingers were swollen and red in just a couple of hours.
